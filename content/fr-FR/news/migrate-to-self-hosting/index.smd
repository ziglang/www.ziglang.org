You often hear this story in tech news: some project got increasingly popular,
so they had to migrate from their simple, one-computer setup to some kind of
autoscaling cloud hosting solution to meet demands.

The Rust Foundation for example, reports that they spent
[$404,400 on infrastructure costs in 2023](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/static/publications/annual-reports/annual-report-2023.pdf).
That's 88% of ZSF's [entire operating costs in 2024](https://ziglang.org/news/2024-financials/).
It's hard to find the exact number from Python Software Foundation's financials because their infrastructure
costs are sponsored, but suffice to say
[PyPI wheel storage is huge and exponentially growing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPmefnqirHk):

In this story, however, we take the opposite approach.

ziglang.org used to be hosted on Amazon S3 + CloudFront, but as it became more
expensive to run due to increased traffic, we have migrated to a one-computer
solution for the website and tarball hosting.

Our AWS costs over the last 6 years looks like this:

Amazon sometimes offers free credits to organizations like ours, but despite
being a non-profit with our primary source of income being unrestricted
donations, we don't like begging for money, especially from Jeff Bezos and his
ilk. We like the idea of increasing overall computing efficiency rather than
externalizing costs onto someone with deep pockets.

The thing is, ziglang.org is not an essential service. It's not really an
emergency if it goes down, and 99% uptime is perfectly fine for this use case.
The funny thing about that [last 1% of uptime is that it represents 99% of the
costs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle).

With that in mind, here is the plan. As traffic to ziglang.org continues to
increase, we will continue to host the website and tarballs on the same €36
Hetzner instance, perhaps someday upgrading it to a €100-200 beefier machine,
but not more than that.

If the website is temporarily unavailable because of too much traffic, so be
it. If it gets accidentally DDoS'd by too many people not [properly caching
their CI runs](https://ziggit.dev/t/github-actions-mlugg-setup-zig/4659), so be
it. That's why we sign artifacts with a static public key, so that you can use
mirrors.

Instead of spending donation money eating these costs which are ultimately due
to inefficient use of computing resources, we push those otherwise hidden costs
onto users of Zig, causing Zig users in general to avoid waste, and then we
have more money to spend on paying contributors for their time.

So far, so good. We're enjoying instant website deploys rather than waiting 5
minutes after pushing.

Moving forward, we'll look into providing torrent files for releases. In the
meantime, big thanks to [slimsag](https://slimsag.com/) and
[hryx](https://hryx.net/) for [providing mirrors of Zig
releases](https://github.com/mlugg/setup-zig/blob/45d39f8bb4d61ccfb37ea3bd0ad319a5f20e4e77/main.js#L18-L21).
If you want to join them, please submit a pull request to [Setup Zig
Compiler](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-zig-compiler). In any
case, by using this particular GitHub Action that integrates with mirrors,
you'll not only be doing us a favor, but you'll make your own CI more
resilient.

Happy hacking,

Andrew
