The Zig community is decentralized. Anyone is free to start and maintain their
own space for the community to gather and submit a pull request to edit this
page to add a link.

There is no concept of "official" or "unofficial", however, each gathering
place has its own moderators and rules.

When adding a new community, please append it at the end of the existing list
as a form of courtesy.

See the Compiler Development section (near the end of this page) for
communities dedicated to Zig compiler development collaboration.

Due to time constraints, the Zig Core Team reserves the right to arbitrarily

## Reddit

(This section written by Andrew Kelley)

I used to moderate the /r/zig subreddit. During the Reddit protests in June
2023, I decided to permanently shut down /r/zig, making it private, encouraging
users to head to ziggit.dev instead.

A troll messaged Reddit admins and gained moderator access to /r/zig, re-opened
the subreddit, and started doing juvenile vandalism for a few weeks, before
deciding they had enough fun and abandoning the place.

Next, [Jens Goldberg](https://github.com/Aransentin) messaged the Reddit admins
and managed to become a moderator of /r/zig. He's pretty hands-off, does not do
a lot of moderation, lets the Reddit voting system handle disagreements.

While the subreddit was private, the vast majority of valuable people moved to
other communities. Most of the people who remained were riff raff, willing to
tolerate trolling and more interested in Reddit as a platform than Zig as a
project.

Now, the Zig subreddit is a complete wasteland, and I personally advise against
going there. In fact I have deleted my entire Reddit account.

I don't have the time or energy to evaluate most Zig communities so I can
neither endorse nor anti-endorse them, however, the Zig subreddit is an
exception.

It's an awful place and I stand by my decision to permanently close it. I am
unhappy that it was reopened against my will.

# Streams

## SHOWTIME

The show where members of the Zig community share code and ideas.

https://zig.show/

 * [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2EQzAewrC10KCDFSS4j-zA) 
 * [Newsletter](https://zig.show/newsletter)
 * [Apply to Speak](https://zig.show/speak)
 * [Discord](https://discord.gg/B73sGxF)  
   The Zig SHOWTIME Discord server serves as a coordination tool for organizing the show, and as a place where people invested in the success of Zig can socialize and collaborate together on new projects. The main goal of this space is to create a community of creators (be it code, blogs, videos, or undefined), so that we can all make the most out of our Zig experience. Nobody is born knowing Zig so everyone is welcome to have fun in this server but, if you're unsure whether Zig is the right language for you, it's recommended you check out first other Zig communities as they might be more focused on helping newcomers to the language.
