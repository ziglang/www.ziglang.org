The Zig community is decentralized. Anyone is free to start and maintain their
own [community](/community), which is not subject to these rules.

**This document contains the rules that govern these spaces only:**

* The ziglang organization on Codeberg
* #zig IRC channel on Libera.chat
* Zig project development Zulip chat

The rules here are strict. This space is for focused, on topic, technical work
on the Zig project only. It is everyone's responsibility to maintain a positive
environment, especially when disagreements occur.

## [Strict No LLM / No AI Policy]($section.id('strict-no-llm-no-ai-policy'))

No LLMs for issues.

No LLMs for pull requests.

No LLMs for comments on the bug tracker, including translation. English is
encouraged, but not required. You are welcome to post in your native language
and rely on others to have their own translation tools of choice to interpret
your words.

## [Please do not file a proposal to change the language]($section.id('no-language-proposals'))

Thank you for your interest in improving the Zig language. However, we are not
interested in "drive-by" suggestions.

If you wish to make a language proposal, you must convince a Zig core team
member to file it on your behalf and champion it. Some are paid contractors and
some are volunteers, and they all freely choose how to spend their time. A core
team member may be willing to champion proposals, or maybe not, at their
discretion. Please do not harass Zig core team members.

## [Safe, Constructive Behavior Only]($section.id('safe-constructive-only'))

Examples of behavior that contribute to creating a positive environment include:

 * Using welcoming and inclusive language.
 * Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
 * Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
 * Helping another person accomplish their own goals.
 * Showing empathy towards others.
 * Showing appreciation for others' work.
 * Validating someone else's experience, skills, insight, and use cases.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

 * Unwelcome sexual attention or advances, or use of sexualized language or
   imagery that causes discomfort.
 * Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal attacks. Anything
   antagonistic towards someone else.
 * Off-topic discussion of any kind - especially offensive or sensitive issues.
 * Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
   address, without explicit permission.
 * Discussing this Code of Conduct or publicly accusing someone of violating it.
 * Making someone else feel like an outsider or implying a lack of technical
   abilities.
 * Destructive behavior. Anything that harms Zig or another open-source project.

## [Enforcement]($section.id('enforcement'))

If you need to report an issue you can contact Andrew Kelley or Loris Cro, who
are both paid by the Zig Software Foundation, and so moderation of this space
is part of our job. We will swiftly remove anyone who is antagonizing others or
being generally destructive.

This includes Private Harassment. If person A is directly harassed or
antagonized by person B, person B will be blocked from participating in this
space even if the harassment didn't take place on one of the mediums directly
under rule of this Code of Conduct.

As noted, discussing this Code of Conduct should not take place on Codeberg,
IRC, or Zulip because these spaces are for directly working on code, not for
meta-discussion. If you have any issues with it, you can contact me directly,
or you can join one of the community spaces that has different rules.

 * Andrew Kelley <andrew@ziglang.org>
 * Loris Cro <loris@ziglang.org>

## [Conclusion]($section.id('conclusion'))

Thanks for reading the rules. Together, we can make this space welcoming and
inclusive for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity,
sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race,
religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
