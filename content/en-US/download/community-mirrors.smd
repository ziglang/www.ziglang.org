If you're setting something up which will automatically download Zig, like CI, you might be interested in using community mirrors instead of downloading from
ziglang.org.

The ziglang.org website does not offer any uptime or speed guarantees, meaning that your CI will sporadically fail or have slower runs if it hardcodes it as a
download URL. In fact, configuring your CI to fetch from ziglang.org directly contributes to uptime and speed issues, because this site is [intentionally hosted
on a simple one-computer configuration](/news/migrate-to-self-hosting). Instead, it is often a good idea to fetch Zig from one of many community-maintained
mirrors. These mirrors are not officially endorsed by the Zig Software Foundation, but they can be used without security risks thanks to our signing of
archives. While no individual mirror has an uptime or speed guarantee, configuring your automation to cycle through the list of available mirrors can
effectively guarantee high uptime in practice.

> page](/download).

## GitHub Actions

If you are setting up an automation using GitHub Actions, you may be interested in the
[mlugg/setup-zig](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-zig-compiler) Action (note that this is not an official ZSF project). Not only does it install a
Zig version of your choice from a community mirror, but it also saves your Zig cache directory between workflow runs, allowing for faster rebuilds.

## Using Mirrors

The list of community mirrors is available in a newline-separated ASCII text file at https://ziglang.org/download/community-mirrors.txt. Tooling is recommended
to fetch this list and try mirrors in a randomized order (to avoid putting excessive load on any one mirror, as this slows it down for everyone).

Every Zig tarball is associated with a [minisign](https://jedisct1.github.io/minisign/) signature file, which can also be downloaded from mirrors. **When you
download a tarball from a mirror, you must also download its associated signature and verify the tarball against it.** Failing to check the signature could
theoretically leave you vulnerable to malicious mirrors hosting modified tarballs.

Put simply, the recommended strategy is approximately this pseudocode:

```python
pubkey = "(copy this from https://ziglang.org/download)"
tarball_name = "zig-x86_64-linux-0.14.1.tar.xz"
# To improve uptime, optionally cache this GET:
mirrors = http_get("https://ziglang.org/download/community-mirrors.txt")
# ASCII-encoded, one mirror per line, newlines are LF, there is a trailing newline.
shuffled = shuffle_lines(mirrors)
for mirror_url in shuffled:
    tarball = http_get(f"{mirror_url}/{tarball_name}?source=my_automation_name")
    if not success:
        continue # failed to download tarball

    # NEVER SKIP THESE STEPS. The signature must be verified before the tarball is deemed safe.
    signature = http_get(f"{mirror_url}/{tarball_name}.minisig?source=my_automation_name")
    if not success:
        continue # failed to download signature file

    if not minisign_verify(tarball, signature, pubkey):
        continue # failed to verify signature file

    # The signature files provided by the ZSF include a "file" field in the trusted 
    # comment that indicates the tarball the signature applies to.
    # This must be verified against the requested tarball name to prevent downgrade attacks.
    actual_tarball_name = minisign_signature_parse_filename(signature)
    if actual_tarball_name != tarball_name:
        continue # wrong tarball provided

    print("Successfully fetched Zig 0.14.1!")
    break
```

Because ziglang.org does not have guaranteed uptime, the `community-mirrors.txt` file may at times become inaccessible. For this reason, you may wish to
consider caching its contents to prevent disruption in the event that ziglang.org encounters downtime. The recommended refetch interval is approximately
once per day. At this point in time, mirrors may be added or removed on a monthly basis as the ecosystem evolves, so periodic re-fetching is essential.

Written more precisely, here is the key information and recommend workflow for downloading Zig tarballs:

* The mirror list file is available at https://ziglang.org/download/community-mirrors.txt.
  * Because ziglang.org does not guarantee uptime, it may be desirable to cache this file.
* The mirror list file contains ASCII-encoded mirror URLs, separated with newline characters (ASCII LF 0x20). There is a trailing newline. There is no other whitespace. There are no blank lines.
* Mirrors are required to support HTTPS. Every line in the mirror list file begins with "https://".
* Mirrors cannot guarantee uptime, so if one fails to serve you a tarball, you should try another. Ideally, shuffle the list, and try each mirror in turn.
  * Usually, the first one will work. If no mirror works, you may choose to try `ziglang.org` as a final fallback.
* To download a tarball from a mirror, perform a GET request to "mirror/filename", where "mirror" is the mirror URL, and "filename" is the basename of the corresponding tarball on ziglang.org (e.g. `zig-x86_64-linux-0.14.1.tar.xz`).
  * You are highly encouraged to include in your request a query parameter named `source` containing a string indicating what is making this request. For instance, the `mlugg/setup-zig` GitHub Action passes it as `?source=github-mlugg-setup-zig`.
  * Source tarballs, bootstrap tarballs, and binary tarballs are available from all listed mirrors, as well as minisign signatures for all such files.
  * Binary tarballs for recent Zig versions are of the form `zig-x86_64-linux-0.14.1.tar.xz`.
  * If a mirror responds with a HTTP status code other than 200 OK:
    * `503 Unavailable` may indicate scheduled downtime.
    * `429 Too Many Requests` may indicate intentional rate-limiting.
    * `404 Not Found` is a permitted response when requesting Zig releases 0.5.0 or earlier, or Zig development builds earlier than the current latest release.
    * `504 Gateway Timeout` indicates that the tarball is unavailable because `https://ziglang.org/` is currently inaccessible (and the tarball is not in the mirror's cache).
    * Otherwise, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/ziglang/www.ziglang.org/issues/new) to inform us of the problem.
* After downloading a tarball, the following verification steps are required: **Never skip these step.**
  * Every time a tarball is downloaded, it is **essential** to also download the minisign signature (suffix the filename with ".minisig") and verify it against the ZSF's public key (which you should copy from the ziglang.org/download page).
  * To prevent downgrade attacks, a "file" field in the [trusted comment](https://jedisct1.github.io/minisign/#:~:text=Trusted%20comments) is provided that must be verified to match the name of the requested tarball. The reference implementation, `minisign`, will verify the trusted comment but does **not** look for a "file" field, so this verification step must be implemented manually.
  * If a mirror responds with `200 OK` but signature validation fails on the returned tarball, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/ziglang/www.ziglang.org/issues/new) to inform us of the problem.

## Hosting a Mirror

If you are interested in hosting a mirror, please consult the [documentation in the www.ziglang.org
repository](https://github.com/ziglang/www.ziglang.org/blob/main/MIRRORS.md). Thank you for helping
to improve and decentralize the Zig ecosystem!
