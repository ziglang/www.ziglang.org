# Donor Bounty: Add Support for '-x' In Zig's macOS Linker

As part of our [Donor Bounty Program](/news/announcing-donor-bounties/), a new 
bounty proposed by Zeke Gabrielse (founder of [https://keygen.sh](https://keygen.sh)) has been confirmed.

## Criteria

Implement [support for '-x' in Zig's macOS Linker](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/21721).

For any clarification feel free to comment on the issue.

Since donor bounties result in a donation to the foundation, there is only to
gain by addressing the issue in a collaborative manner.

It doesn't matter who implements it, or whether multiple people work together
on implementing it, or how much help is needed from the core Zig team. As long
as it gets done properly and the donor is satisfied with the results, the
bounty will be awarded.

## Reward

Zeke has kindly offered a bounty of 2,500 USD to be donated to Zig Software 
Foundation if the criteria can be met by **July 13, 2025**.

Good luck!
