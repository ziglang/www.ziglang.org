We've taken part to FOSDEM 2021 and we are looking for talk submissions.

## About FOSDEM

[FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/) is a free conference ordinarily hosted in Europe. This year it will be held on-line for the first time. There is no registration, but attendees are expected to follow [FOSDEM's code of conduct](https://fosdem.org/2021/practical/conduct/).

## Call for Papers

### What we're looking for

We're interested in all kinds of talks about Zig, of course! If you want to make your talk a bit more in-theme with the conference at large, take a peek at what FOSDEM published from previous years. Also, keep in mind, it's a conference centered around Open Source software.

### How to apply

All submissions must be made through [FOSDEM's pentabarf website](https://penta.fosdem.org/). Make sure to select the "Zig Programming Language Devroom" when submitting. 

**You must also make sure to be able to fulfill all requirements to be able to present, as listed in the next section.** [Here you can sign up](https://penta.fosdem.org/user/new_account).

### Prerequisites & Talk details

- The default duration for each talk is 45 mins including Q&A. You can have a shorter talk to leave more time for the Q&A, but make sure to leave at least 10 mins for it.
- Talks will be pre-recorded in advance and streamed by FOSDEM during the event. This means that you will need to complete and submit your talk by around mid January.
- The conference will run during European day hours. This is important because after the talk airs, you will have to be present for the live Q&A.
- The Zig Devroom will run for half a day on Saturday. We don't know yet the precise times.

### Deadlines

- Submission deadline: Dec 23rd, 2020
- Selected talks announced by Dec 31st, 2020
- Conference dates 6 & 7 February 2021 online
- The Zig Devroom will run on Saturday 6th.
- Talk video submission is mid January.

## Questions?

If you have any question, feel free to contact me via email (loris at ziglang.org), or on Discord. You can find me on both currently existing Zig Discord communities.
