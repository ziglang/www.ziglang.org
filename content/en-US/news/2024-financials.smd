[Next Year](/news/2025-financials)

Zig Software Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization which I am proud
to say makes **extremely efficient use of monetary resources**. Unlike many of
our peers, our primary expense is direct payments to contributors for their
enhancements to the Zig project.

Don't take my word for it - let's look at some numbers.

## 2023 Expenditures

the median salary for a Lead Software Engineer in New York City at the time.
<br><br>
I have never once received my full salary. At the time of writing, I am accepting
$108,000/year (before taxes) and donating the rest to ZSF. In the past I have donated
an even larger portion. In the future I think it would be nice to be fully
compensated.

<td class="description">Zig has great cross-compiling abilities in part
due to investing in testing infrastructure for different systems. Some of these costs were
one-time costs to purchase machines that sit in our homes and offices while others
are market-rate Hetzner bare metal machines that we run GitHub Actions on.
<br><br>
Some of this cost is for hosting ziglang.org. Since our free AWS credits have expired
we have plans to switch to Fastly which should save about $500/month.

that the previous year's travel budget successfully helped grow Zig adoption,
and raised the budget from $10,000 to $15,000. In 2023, ZSF spent $10,847
of those allocated funds, increasing Zig's presence in North America (e.g. Seattle, Vancouver) and Europe (e.g. Stockholm, Berlin, Amsterdam) as well as keeping up relationships with likeminded communities like

**We spent 92% of our money in 2023 on paying contributors for their time.**

So far so good. You can see we've been hard at work spending our esteemed
donors' money on advancing the [mission statement](https://ziglang.org/zsf/#mission-statement).

However, if we look at the trend of donations over time for the year 2023, we
see overall a slow decline. This is likely due to the fact that we have slacked
off on *asking for money*.

## 2023 Donations Per Month

            }).format(n);
        }
      },
    }
  );
</script>

Meanwhile, **user activity has skyrocketed**. A rapidly increasing user base
is adding Zig to their software stacks, filing issues, sending pull requests,
asking for help, and shipping software that depends on Zig.

However, with our current level of recurring income, we will not be able to renew
everyone's contracts, nor offer new contracts to Zig core team members.

## A Plea for Donations

We have extremely talented Zig core team members who want to renew their
contracts, and others who are interested to start getting paid for their
valuable work for the first time.

In order to do this, **we need more recurring donations**. I for one do not enjoy
asking for money, but in the interest of our users and contributors, it would
be irresponsible not to.

**Please sign up for a monthly donation** if you can. Our preferred donation method
is [via Every.org](https://www.every.org/zig-software-foundation-inc/f/help-zig-stay-indepe).
A fellow 501(c)(3) non-profit, they seamlessly manage gift receipts, and are not 
pivoting to AI [like GitHub is currently doing](https://github.blog/2023-11-08-universe-2023-copilot-transforms-github-into-the-ai-powered-developer-platform/), which frankly scares the shit
out of us.
