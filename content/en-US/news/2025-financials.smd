Zig Software Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization which I am proud
to say makes **extremely efficient use of monetary resources**. Unlike many of
our peers, our primary expense is direct payments to contributors for their
enhancements to the Zig project.

Don't take my word for it - let's look at some numbers.

## 2024 Expenditures

Lead Software Engineer. In 2024, I also volunteered my time as President of Zig Software Foundation,
volunteered as Accounting Clerk, and volunteered as Development Director. In the future, it would be
nice to have dedicated staff for these roles so that I could focus more on being Lead Software Engineer.

<td class="description">Zig has great cross-compiling abilities in part

are market-rate Hetzner bare metal machines that we run GitHub Actions on.

that the previous year's travel budget successfully helped grow Zig adoption,
and retained the same budget of $15,000. In 2024, ZSF spent $6,956
of those allocated funds, increasing Zig's presence in <a href="https://softwareyoucan.love/">Italy</a> and <a href="https://zigtoberfest.de/">Germany</a>.

<a href="https://www.mingw-w64.org/">mingw-w64</a>, and others.
ZSF donates money to these projects as a way to say thanks, give back to the ecosystem,

**Even with a 13% bigger budget, we still managed to spend 92% of our money in
2024 paying contributors for their time.**

So far so good. You can see we've been hard at work spending our esteemed
donors' money on advancing the [mission statement](https://ziglang.org/zsf/#mission-statement).

However, if we look at the trend of donations over time for the year 2024, we
see overall a slow decline. This is why we're doing another fundraiser this year.

## 2024-2025 Donations Per Month

      series: [[41881.89,68173.17,41883.42,27567.52,45144.37,37637.42,40575.75,48196.08,195603.50,52408.64,30576.44,41024.39, 46196.88,39968.66,58394.73,40902.10,19388.97,20131.89,17158.33]]

            }).format(n);
        }
      },
    }
  );
</script>
```

The big spike is [half of Mitchell Hashimoto's pledge](/news/300k-from-mitchellh/).

More to the point, the second half will buy us another year to raise donations in order to
keep our bank balance positive. ZSF neither borrows money nor lends money; we convert
donations directly into progress on the Zig project.

            }).format(n);
        }
      },
    }
  );
</script>
```

Meanwhile, **user activity continues to skyrocket**. A rapidly increasing user base
is adding Zig to their software stacks, filing issues, sending pull requests,
asking for help, and shipping software that depends on Zig.

However, with our current level of recurring income, we will not be able to renew
everyone's contracts, nor offer new contracts to Zig core team members.

## A Plea for Donations

We have extremely talented Zig core team members who want to renew their
contracts, and others who are interested to start getting paid for their
valuable work for the first time.

In order to do this, **we need more recurring donations**. I for one do not enjoy
asking for money, but in the interest of our users and contributors, it would
be irresponsible not to.

**Please sign up for a monthly donation** if you can. Our preferred donation method
is [via Every.org](https://www.every.org/zig-software-foundation-inc/f/help-zig-stay-indepe).
A fellow 501(c)(3) non-profit, they seamlessly manage gift receipts, and are not 
pivoting to AI [like GitHub is currently doing](https://www.businessinsider.com/github-ceo-developers-embrace-ai-or-get-out-2025-8).
