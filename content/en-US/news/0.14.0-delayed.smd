Hello everyone,

Happy Valentine's Day. You are all my valentines.

To [quote myself](/news/what-to-expect-from-release-month/):

> I am now setting a hard deadline...

Statements dreamed up by the utterly deranged.

To keep it brief - planned 0.14.0 release date is moved to **Monday, March 3rd**,
three days after [HYTRADBOI](https://www.hytradboi.com/2025/).

Mainly, there's a good chance Jacob will have progressed the x86_64 backend far enough that
we can [enable it by default for Debug mode on ELF targets](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/22257).

Secondly, there are some important pull requests in the queue that I didn't get to yet.

Thanks all - your patience will be rewarded with ~4x faster compilation and
[better debugging experience](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/wiki/LLDB-for-Zig).

Andrew
