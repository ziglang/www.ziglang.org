# [Zig Bootstrap Porting Progress]($section.id('2024-11-19'))

Author: Alex Rønne Petersen

The [zig-bootstrap](https://github.com/ziglang/zig-bootstrap) project makes it possible to produce a
Zig compiler to run on (almost) any target with minimal system dependencies on the build machine. As
part of my recent port work on Zig, I made it a goal to get zig-bootstrap working on as many of our
supported cross-compilation target triples (`zig targets | jq -r .libc[]`) as reasonably possible.
I'm happy to report that this effort is now complete.

At time of writing, the list of target triples supported by zig-bootstrap is as follows:

* `aarch64-linux-(gnu,musl)`
* `aarch64-macos-none`
* `aarch64-windows-gnu`
* `aarch64_be-linux-(gnu,musl)`
* `arm[eb]-linux-(gnu,musl)eabi[hf]`
* `loongarch64-linux-(gnu,gnusf,musl)`
* `mips[el]-linux-(gnu,musl)eabi[hf]`
* `mips64[el]-linux-(gnu,musl)abi(64,n32)`
* `powerpc-linux-(gnu,musl)eabi[hf]`
* `powerpc64-linux-musl`
* `powerpc64le-linux-(gnu,musl)`
* `riscv(32,64)-linux-(gnu,musl)`
* `s390x-linux-(gnu,musl)`
* `thumb[eb]-linux-musleabi[hf]`
* `thumb-windows-gnu`
* `x86-linux-(gnu,musl)`
* `x86-windows-gnu`
* `x86_64-linux-(gnu,musl)[x32]`
* `x86_64-macos-none`
* `x86_64-windows-gnu`

[The latest list can be found here.](https://github.com/ziglang/zig-bootstrap/blob/master/README.md#supported-triples)

If you've been itching to run Zig on some unusual or obscure target, please take zig-bootstrap for a
spin and see how it works for you. If you run into any build issues, please report those on the
[zig-bootstrap](https://github.com/ziglang/zig-bootstrap) repository; issues with running the built
compiler should be reported on [ziglang/zig](https://github.com/ziglang/zig).

# [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Naming Integers]($section.id('2024-11-04'))

Author: Andrew Kelley

Lately my Zig code has started to look like this in all my projects:

```zig
/// Uniquely identifies a section index across all objects. Each Object has a section_start field.
/// By subtracting that value from this one, the Object section index is obtained.
const SectionIndex = enum(u32) {
    _,
};

/// Index into object_function_imports
pub const ObjectFunctionImportIndex = enum(u32) {
    _,
};

/// Index into `object_global_imports`
pub const ObjectGlobalImportIndex = enum(u32) {
    _,
};

/// Index into object_table_imports.
pub const ObjectTableImportIndex = enum(u32) {
    _,
};

/// Index into `function_imports`.
pub const FunctionImportIndex = enum(u32) {
    _,
};

/// Index into `global_imports`.
pub const GlobalImportIndex = enum(u32) {
    _,
};

/// Index into `table_imports`.
pub const TableImportIndex = enum(u32) {
    _,
};

/// Index into `memory_imports`.
pub const MemoryImportIndex = enum(u32) {
    _,
};

/// Index into `output_globals`.
pub const GlobalIndex = enum(u32) {
    _,
};

/// Index into `functions`.
pub const FunctionIndex = enum(u32) {
    _,
};

/// Index into object_functions
pub const ObjectFunctionIndex = enum(u32) {
    _,

    pub fn toOptional(i: ObjectFunctionIndex) OptionalObjectFunctionIndex {
        const result: OptionalObjectFunctionIndex = @enumFromInt(@intFromEnum(i));
        assert(result != .none);
        return result;
    }
};

/// Index into object_functions, or null.
pub const OptionalObjectFunctionIndex = enum(u32) {
    none = std.math.maxInt(u32),
    _,

    pub fn unwrap(i: OptionalObjectFunctionIndex) ?ObjectFunctionIndex {
        if (i == .none) return null;
        return @enumFromInt(@intFromEnum(i));
    }
};
```

It's uncanny how effective it is to avoid bugs by simply naming integers and
thereby giving Zig's type system a chance to catch mistakes. It's extremely
annoying and time consuming to troubleshoot this kind of mistake at runtime,
but it's *trivial* to solve when you get a compile error from a type mismatch.

# [Anonymous Struct Types Removed]($section.id('2024-11-01'))

Author: Matthew Lugg

Rejoice, ye faithful; the days of undocumented structural aggregate types are over!

Until recently, Zig had the notion of an "anonymous struct type". When you wrote `.{ .x = 123 }`
with no [result type][result-type], it would give this value an "anonymous struct" type, which is a
special kind of struct which can coerce to other types based on *structure* rather than identity. In
other words, this worked:

```zig
test "coerce anonymous struct" {
    const foo = .{ .x = 123 };
    const S = struct { x: ?u32 };
    // It's true that `@TypeOf(foo) != S`, and yet...
    const bar: S = foo; // ...this works!
    try std.testing.expect(bar.x.? == 123);
}
const std = @import("std");
```

A little bit of trivia: this existed because a long time ago, Zig didn't actually have the concept
of a "result type", so *all* type annotations worked via coercions like that!

I [proposed removing this system][anon-struct-proposal] last year, and finally got around to
[actually doing it][anon-struct-pr] last week. You can still write `.{ .x = 123 }` without a result
type, but it's given a "normal" struct type, with no magical coercions allowed. So now, the above
code example fails just like you'd expect:

```
example.zig:5:20: error: expected type 'example.test.coerce anonymous struct.S', found 'example.test.coerce anonymous struct__struct_90'
    const bar: S = foo; // ...this works!
                   ^~~
example.zig:2:18: note: struct declared here
    const foo = .{ .x = 123 };
                ~^~~~~~~~~~~~
example.zig:3:15: note: struct declared here
    const S = struct { x: ?u32 };
              ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

Good riddance!

# [File Watching Implemented for kqueue]($section.id('2024-10-29'))

Author: Andrew Kelley

I knocked out [#20599](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/20599) on a plane
ride last week (coincidentally on the way to a [KQ
tournament](https://bumblebeargames.com/pages/bumblebash-5)), so if you're
tracking master branch, you can now use the `zig build --watch` feature on
macOS, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, DragonFlyBSD, and Haiku.

This feature tracks all file system inputs, automatically repeating invalidated
build steps. It can be quite handy when refactoring a codebase using a
terminal-based workflow since it means seeing instant feedback when any build
inputs - source code or otherwise - are updated.

KQueue allows placing a watch on an open directory handle, but the event does
not indicate the name of the changed file within any given directory. This is
no problem for the Zig Build System. If any directory that contains watched
files are triggered, the respective steps are invalidated, and then those steps
use fstat to determine if the cached artifacts are still valid.

# [CI Coverage Added for Incremental Compilation]($section.id('2024-10-06'))

Author: Matthew Lugg

Over the last few months, myself and Jakub have been working hard on incremental
compilation, where the compiler can "remember" parts of a previous build and only
re-compile the code that changed. We just hit an important milestone here: **our CI
test suite [now includes][incr-ci-pr] our "incremental compilation" tests!** This set
of tests is small right now, but will grow rapidly as we fix bugs and, eventually,
fuzz test the implementation.

You can find all our incremental compilation test cases [here][incr-cases]. The CI runs
all of them on `x86_64-linux` with the self-hosted x86_64 backend, as well as on a few
targets with the C backend (`-ofmt=c`). It's approaching the point where you *can*
start to use incremental compilation in some very basic cases; for instance, I've
recently managed to perform an incremental update on [Andrew's Tetris clone][tetris].

If you're using a `master` build of Zig on Linux on x86_64, you can try playing
with incremental compilation **right now** with this command:

```
zig build -fincremental --watch
```

(Make sure your `Step.Compile` has `.use_llvm = false, .use_lld = false`, so Zig
doesn't try to use LLVM!)

Beware, though, that you'll run into bugs pretty quickly, including false
positive compile errors and even miscompilations; use at your own risk.

# [New Devlog Structure]($section.id('2024-09-30'))
Author: Loris Cro

The devlog has switched to a per-year pre-sharded structure to avoid the issue of
having a page that grows indefinitely.

**NOTE:** the RSS feed link has not changed. No action needed from RSS feed
consumers. Cached links to older entries might become stale, but new entries from
now on will have the correct link.

# [loongarch64 added to the download page]($section.id('2024-09-24'))

Author: Andrew Kelley

Thanks to contributions from [YANG Xudong](https://github.com/yxd-ym) and
[Alex Rønne Petersen](https://www.alexrp.com/), along with
[upgrading to LLVM 19](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/commit/c6ad4521c77372cb52adfb9a52b0854d830fed9c),
loongarch64 support in Zig is progressed enough that
[zig-bootstrap](https://github.com/ziglang/zig-bootstrap) works for this
target. In celebration, I have added loongarch64-linux to [the download
page](/download/).

# [2024-09-16]($section.id('2024-09-16'))

Author: Andrew Kelley

I've been porting stb_truetype.h to Zig on the side. Check out this snippet:

```c
{
    float sum = 0;
    for (i=0; i < result->w; ++i) {
      float k;
      int m;
      sum += scanline2[i];
      k = scanline[i] + sum;
      k = (float) STBTT_fabs(k)*255 + 0.5f;
      m = (int) k;
      if (m > 255) m = 255;
      result->pixels[j*result->stride + i] = (unsigned char) m;
    }
}
```
⬇️
```zig
{
    var sum: f32 = 0;
    for (scanline, scanline2, result.pixels[j*result.stride..][0..result.w]) |s, s2, *p| {
        sum += s2;
        p.* = @min(@abs(s + sum)*255 + 0.5, 255);
    }
}
```

Ahh, much better.

# [Zig tokenizer updated to use labeled switch statements]($section.id('2024-09-11'))

Author: Andrew Kelley

Now that Matthew landed [labeled switch continue syntax](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/pull/21257), it's time
to start using it.

[Eric Petersen swooped in for a first-time contribution](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/pull/21367),
updating Zig's tokenizer to use the new syntax, measuring a 13% wall time
performance increase for the `zig ast-check` command:

![](perf.png "perf benchmark screenshot")

This line of code tickles me:

```zig
state: switch (State.start) {
```
