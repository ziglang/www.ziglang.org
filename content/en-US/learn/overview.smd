# Feature Highlights
## [Small, simple language]($heading.id('small-simple-language'))

Focus on debugging your application rather than debugging your programming language knowledge.

Zig's entire syntax is specified with a [580-line PEG grammar file](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Grammar).

There is **no hidden control flow**, no hidden memory allocations, no preprocessor, and no macros. If Zig code doesn't look like it's jumping away to call a function, then it isn't. This means you can be sure that the following code calls only `foo()` and then `bar()`, and this is guaranteed without needing to know the types of anything:

```zig
var a = b + c.d;
foo();
bar();
```

Examples of hidden control flow:

- D has `@property` functions, which are methods that you call with what looks like field access, so in the above example, `c.d` might call a function.
- C++, D, and Rust have operator overloading, so the `+` operator might call a function.
- C++, D, and Go have throw/catch exceptions, so `foo()` might throw an exception, and prevent `bar()` from being called.

 Zig promotes code maintenance and readability by making all control flow managed exclusively with language keywords and function calls.

## [Performance and Safety: Choose Two]($heading.id('performance-and-safety-choose-two'))

Zig has four [build modes](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Build-Mode), and they can all be mixed and matched all the way down to [scope granularity](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#setRuntimeSafety).

| Parameter | [Debug](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Debug) | [ReleaseSafe](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#ReleaseSafe) | [ReleaseFast](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#ReleaseFast) | [ReleaseSmall](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#ReleaseSmall) |
|-----------|-------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
Optimizations - improve speed, harm debugging, harm compile time | | On | On | On |
Runtime Safety Checks - harm speed, harm size, crash instead of undefined behavior | On | On | | |

Here is what [Integer Overflow](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Integer-Overflow) looks like at compile time, regardless of the build mode:

[]($code.language('=html').buildAsset('features/1-integer-overflow.zig'))

Here is what it looks like at runtime, in safety-checked builds:

[]($code.language('=html').buildAsset('features/2-integer-overflow-runtime.zig'))


Those [stack traces work on all targets](#stack-traces-on-all-targets), including [freestanding](https://andrewkelley.me/post/zig-stack-traces-kernel-panic-bare-bones-os.html).

With Zig one can rely on a safety-enabled build mode, and selectively disable safety at the performance bottlenecks. For example the previous example could be modified like this:

[]($code.language('=html').buildAsset('features/3-undefined-behavior.zig'))

Zig uses [Illegal Behavior](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Illegal-Behavior) as a razor sharp tool for both bug prevention and performance enhancement.

Speaking of performance, Zig is faster than C.

- All Zig code lives in one compilation unit, optimized together.
- Carefully chosen illegal behavior. For example, in Zig both signed and unsigned integers have illegal behavior on overflow, contrasted to only signed integers in C. This [facilitates optimizations that are not available in C](https://godbolt.org/z/vhjv9oM1W).
- Zig directly exposes a [SIMD vector type](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Vectors), making it easy to write portable vectorized code.
- The standard library provides essential data structures such as hash maps and array lists, whereas in C it is tempting to use linked lists for simplicity.
- Advanced CPU features are enabled by default, unless [cross-compiling](#cross-compiling-is-a-first-class-use-case).

## Zig competes with C instead of depending on it

The Zig Standard Library integrates with libc, but does not depend on it. Here's Hello World:

[]($code.language('=html').buildAsset('features/4-hello.zig'))

When compiled with `-O ReleaseSmall`, debug symbols stripped, single-threaded mode, this produces a 9.8 KiB static executable for the x86_64-linux target:
```
$ zig build-exe hello.zig -O ReleaseSmall -fstrip -fsingle-threaded
$ wc -c hello
9944 hello
$ ldd hello
  not a dynamic executable
```

A Windows build is even smaller, coming out to 4096 bytes:
```
$ zig build-exe hello.zig -O ReleaseSmall -fstrip -fsingle-threaded -target x86_64-windows
$ wc -c hello.exe
4096 hello.exe
$ file hello.exe
hello.exe: PE32+ executable (console) x86-64, for MS Windows
```

## Order independent top level declarations

Top level declarations such as global variables are order-independent and lazily analyzed. The initialization values of global variables are [evaluated at compile-time](#compile-time-reflection-and-compile-time-code-execution).

[]($code.language('=html').buildAsset('features/5-global-variables.zig'))

## Optional type instead of null pointers

In other programming languages, null references are the source of many runtime exceptions, and even stand accused of being [the worst mistake of computer science](https://www.lucidchart.com/techblog/2015/08/31/the-worst-mistake-of-computer-science/).

Unadorned Zig pointers cannot be null:

[]($code.language('=html').buildAsset('features/6-null-to-ptr.zig'))

However any type can be made into an [optional type](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Optionals) by prefixing it with `?`:

[]($code.language('=html').buildAsset('features/7-optional-syntax.zig'))

To unwrap an optional value, one can use `orelse` to provide a default value:

[]($code.language('=html').buildAsset('features/8-optional-orelse.zig'))

Another option is to use if:

[]($code.language('=html').buildAsset('features/9-optional-if.zig'))

 The same syntax works with [while](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#while):

[]($code.language('=html').buildAsset('features/10-optional-while.zig'))

## Manual memory management

A library written in Zig is eligible to be used anywhere:

- [Desktop applications](https://isaacfreund.com/software/river/)
- Low-latency servers
- [Databases](https://tigerbeetle.com/)
- Operating System kernels
- [Embedded devices](https://microzig.tech/)
- Real-time software, e.g. live performances, airplanes, pacemakers
- In web browsers or other plugins with WebAssembly
- By other programming languages, using the C ABI

In order to accomplish this, Zig programmers must manage their own memory, and must handle memory allocation failure.

This is true of the Zig Standard Library as well. Any functions that need to allocate memory accept an allocator parameter. As a result, the Zig Standard Library can be used even for the freestanding target.

In addition to [A fresh take on error handling](#a-fresh-take-on-error-handling), Zig provides [defer](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#defer) and [errdefer](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#errdefer) to make all resource management - not only memory - simple and easily verifiable.

For an example of `defer`, see [Integration with C libraries without FFI/bindings](#integration-with-c-libraries-without-ffibindings). Here is an example of using `errdefer`:
[]($code.language('=html').buildAsset('features/11-errdefer.zig'))


## [A fresh take on error handling]($heading.id('a-fresh-take-on-error-handling'))

Errors are values, and may not be ignored:

[]($code.language('=html').buildAsset('features/12-errors-as-values.zig'))

Errors can be handled with [catch](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#catch):

[]($code.language('=html').buildAsset('features/13-errors-catch.zig'))

The keyword [try](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#try) is a shortcut for `catch |err| return err`:

[]($code.language('=html').buildAsset('features/14-errors-try.zig'))

Note that is an [Error Return Trace](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Error-Return-Traces), not a [stack trace](#stack-traces-on-all-targets). The code did not pay the price of unwinding the stack to come up with that trace.

The [switch](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#switch) keyword used on an error ensures that all possible errors are handled:

[]($code.language('=html').buildAsset('features/15-errors-switch.zig'))

The keyword [unreachable](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#unreachable) is used to assert that no errors will occur:

[]($code.language('=html').buildAsset('features/16-unreachable.zig'))

This invokes [undefined behavior](#performance-and-safety-choose-two) in the unsafe build modes, so be sure to use it only when success is guaranteed.

### [Stack traces on all targets]($heading.id("stack-traces-on-all-targets"))

The stack traces and [error return traces](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Error-Return-Traces) shown on this page work on all Tier 1 Support and some Tier 2 Support targets. [Even freestanding](https://andrewkelley.me/post/zig-stack-traces-kernel-panic-bare-bones-os.html)!

In addition, the standard library has the ability to capture a stack trace at any point and then dump it to standard error later:

[]($code.language('=html').buildAsset('features/17-stack-traces.zig'))

The standard library's DebugAllocator uses this technique to report leaks and double frees.

## Generic data structures and functions

Types are values that must be known at compile-time:

[]($code.language('=html').buildAsset('features/18-types.zig'))

A generic data structure is simply a function that returns a `type`:

[]($code.language('=html').buildAsset('features/19-generics.zig'))

## [Compile-time reflection and compile-time code execution]($heading.id('compile-time-reflection-and-compile-time-code-execution'))

The [@typeInfo](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#typeInfo) builtin function provides reflection:

[]($code.language('=html').buildAsset('features/20-reflection.zig'))

The Zig Standard Library uses this technique to implement formatted printing. Despite being a [Small, simple language](#small-simple-language), Zig's formatted printing is implemented entirely in Zig. Meanwhile, in C, compile errors for printf are hard-coded into the compiler. Similarly, in Rust, the formatted printing macro is hard-coded into the compiler.

Zig can also evaluate functions and blocks of code at compile-time. In some contexts, such as global variable initializations, the expression is implicitly evaluated at compile-time. Otherwise, one can explicitly evaluate code at compile-time with the [comptime](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#comptime) keyword. This can be especially powerful when combined with assertions:

[]($code.language('=html').buildAsset('features/21-comptime.zig'))

## [Integration with C libraries without FFI/bindings]($heading.id('integration-with-c-libraries-without-ffibindings'))

[@cImport](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#cImport) directly imports types, variables, functions, and simple macros for use in Zig. It even translates inline functions from C into Zig.

Here is an example of emitting a sine wave using [libsoundio](http://libsound.io/):

<u>sine.zig</u>
[]($code.language('=html').buildAsset('features/22-sine-wave.zig'))

```
$ zig build-exe sine.zig -lsoundio -lc
$ ./sine
Output device: Built-in Audio Analog Stereo
^C
```

[This Zig code is significantly simpler than the equivalent C code](https://gist.github.com/andrewrk/d285c8f912169329e5e28c3d0a63c1d8), as well as having more safety protections, and all this is accomplished by directly importing the C header file - no API bindings.

*Zig is better at using C libraries than C is at using C libraries.*

### [Zig is also a C compiler]($heading.id('zig-is-also-a-c-compiler'))

Here's an example of Zig building some C code:

<u>hello.c</u>
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    printf("Hello world\n");
    return 0;
}
```

```
$ zig build-exe hello.c -lc
$ ./hello
Hello world
```

You can use `--verbose-cc` to see what C compiler command this executed:
```
$ zig build-exe hello.c -lc --verbose-cc
zig cc -MD -MV -MF .zig-cache/tmp/42zL6fBH8fSo-hello.o.d -nostdinc -fno-spell-checking -isystem /home/andy/dev/zig/build/lib/zig/include -isystem /home/andy/dev/zig/build/lib/zig/libc/include/x86_64-linux-gnu -isystem /home/andy/dev/zig/build/lib/zig/libc/include/generic-glibc -isystem /home/andy/dev/zig/build/lib/zig/libc/include/x86_64-linux-any -isystem /home/andy/dev/zig/build/lib/zig/libc/include/any-linux-any -march=native -g -fstack-protector-strong --param ssp-buffer-size=4 -fno-omit-frame-pointer -o .zig-cache/tmp/42zL6fBH8fSo-hello.o -c hello.c -fPIC
```

Note that if you run the command again, there is no output, and it finishes instantly:
```
$ time zig build-exe hello.c -lc --verbose-cc

real	0m0.027s
user	0m0.018s
sys	0m0.009s
```

This is thanks to [Build Artifact Caching](https://ziglang.org/download/0.4.0/release-notes.html#Build-Artifact-Caching). Zig automatically parses the .d file using a robust caching system to avoid duplicating work.

Not only can Zig compile C code, but there is a very good reason to use Zig as a C compiler: [Zig ships with libc](#zig-ships-with-libc).

### Export functions, variables, and types for C code to depend on

One of the primary use cases for Zig is exporting a library with the C ABI for other programming languages to call into. The `export` keyword in front of functions, variables, and types causes them to be part of the library API:

<u>mathtest.zig</u>
[]($code.language('=html').buildAsset('features/23-math-test.zig'))

To make a static library:
```
$ zig build-lib mathtest.zig
```

To make a shared library:
```
$ zig build-lib mathtest.zig -dynamic
```

Here is an example with the [Zig Build System](#zig-build-system):

<u>test.c</u>
```c
#include "mathtest.h"
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    int32_t result = add(42, 1337);
    printf("%d\n", result);
    return 0;
}
```

<u>build.zig</u>
[]($code.language('=html').buildAsset('features/24-build.zig'))

```
$ zig build test
1379
```

## [Cross-compiling is a first-class use case]($heading.id('cross-compiling-is-a-first-class-use-case'))

Zig builds for all supported targets independently of the host. There is no separate "cross toolchain" or anything like that. Here's a native Hello World:

[]($code.language('=html').buildAsset('features/4-hello.zig'))

Now to build it for x86_64-windows, x86_64-macos, and aarch64-linux:
```
$ zig build-exe hello.zig -target x86_64-windows
$ file hello.exe
hello.exe: PE32+ executable (console) x86-64, for MS Windows
$ zig build-exe hello.zig -target x86_64-macos
$ file hello
hello: Mach-O 64-bit x86_64 executable, flags:<NOUNDEFS|DYLDLINK|TWOLEVEL|PIE>
$ zig build-exe hello.zig -target aarch64-linux
$ file hello
hello: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, ARM aarch64, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, with debug_info, not stripped
```

This works on any Tier 3+ target, for any Tier 3+ target.

### [Zig ships with libc]($heading.id('zig-ships-with-libc'))

You can find the available libc targets with `zig targets`:
```

  "x86_64-macos-none",
  "x86_64-netbsd-none",
  "x86_64-windows-gnu",
},
...
 ```

This means `-lc` for these targets *does not depend on any system files*!

Let's look at that [C hello world example](#zig-is-also-a-c-compiler) again:
```
$ zig build-exe hello.c -lc
$ ./hello
Hello world
$ ldd ./hello
	linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffd03dc9000)
	libc.so.6 => /lib/libc.so.6 (0x00007fc4b62be000)
	libm.so.6 => /lib/libm.so.6 (0x00007fc4b5f29000)
	libpthread.so.0 => /lib/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007fc4b5d0a000)
	libdl.so.2 => /lib/libdl.so.2 (0x00007fc4b5b06000)
	librt.so.1 => /lib/librt.so.1 (0x00007fc4b58fe000)
	/lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 => /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007fc4b6672000)
```

[glibc](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/) does not support building statically, but [musl](https://www.musl-libc.org/) does:
```
$ zig build-exe hello.c -lc -target x86_64-linux-musl
$ ./hello
Hello world
$ ldd hello
  not a dynamic executable
```

In this example, Zig built musl libc from source and then linked against it. The build of musl libc for x86_64-linux remains available thanks to the [caching system](https://ziglang.org/download/0.4.0/release-notes.html#Build-Artifact-Caching), so any time this libc is needed again it will be available instantly.

This means that this functionality is available on any platform. Windows and macOS users can build Zig and C code, and link against libc, for any of the targets listed above. Similarly code can be cross compiled for other architectures:
```
$ zig build-exe hello.c -lc -target aarch64-linux-gnu
$ file hello
hello: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, ARM aarch64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib/ld-linux-aarch64.so.1, for GNU/Linux 2.0.0, with debug_info, not stripped
```

Zig is a better C compiler than C compilers!

This functionality is more than bundling a cross-compilation toolchain along
with Zig. For example, the total size of libc headers that Zig ships is 130 MiB
uncompressed. Meanwhile, the headers for musl libc + linux headers on x86_64
alone are 8 MiB, and for glibc are 3.1 MiB (glibc is missing the linux
headers), yet Zig currently ships with 97 libcs. With a naive bundling that
would be 776 MiB. However, thanks to this [process_headers
tool](https://codeberg.org/ziglang/zig/src/commit/0.15.2/tools/process_headers.zig), and
some [good old manual labor](https://codeberg.org/ziglang/infra/src/branch/master/libc-update),
Zig binary tarballs remain roughly 50 MiB total, despite supporting libc for
all these targets, as well as compiler-rt, libunwind, libcxx, and libtsan, and
despite being a clang-compatible C compiler. For comparison, the Windows binary
build of clang 8.0.0 itself from llvm.org is 132 MiB.

## [Zig Build System]($heading.id('zig-build-system'))

Zig comes with a build system, so you don't need make, cmake, or anything like that.
```
$ zig init
info: created build.zig
info: created build.zig.zon
info: created src/main.zig
info: created src/root.zig
info: see `zig build --help` for a menu of options

You can see that one of the available steps is run.
```
$ zig build run
All your codebase are belong to us.
Run `zig build test` to run the tests.
```

Here are some example build scripts:

- [Build script of OpenGL Tetris game](https://github.com/andrewrk/tetris/blob/master/build.zig)
- [Build script of bare metal Raspberry Pi 3 arcade game](https://github.com/andrewrk/clashos/blob/master/build.zig)
- [Build script of self-hosted Zig compiler](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/master/build.zig)

## Wide range of targets supported

Zig uses a "support tier" system to communicate the level of support for different targets.

[Support Table as of Zig 0.15](https://ziglang.org/download/0.15.1/release-notes.html#Target-Support)

## Friendly toward package maintainers

Even though Zig is self-hosted, building from source only depends on system
C/C++ toolchain and LLVM, using standard CMake build steps thanks to
[a WebAssembly based bootstrap process](/news/goodbye-cpp/).

For those distributions that want to avoid binary blobs, there is a
well-documented set of steps to
[reproduce Zig without binaries](https://jakstys.lt/2024/zig-reproduced-without-binaries/).

In the future, we hope to inspire a third party to implement a Zig interpreter
written in C that can reduce this to O(1) step.

As Maya Rashish notes,
[porting Zig to other platforms is fun and speedy](http://coypu.sdf.org/porting-zig.html).

Non-debug [build modes](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Build-Mode) are reproducible/deterministic.

There is a [JSON version of the download page](https://ziglang.org/download/index.json).
