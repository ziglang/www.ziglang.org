## 1. Renewing the 2026 travel budget

Synadia and TigerBeetle pledged $512k over 2 years. https://tigerbeetle.com/blog/2025-10-25-synadia-and-tigerbeetle-pledge-512k-to-the-zig-software-foundation/

Last year 2025: $15k budget for travel. About $7k spent (exact value TBD).
* Fewer conferences relative to previous years. No Handmade Con 2025. No Software You Can Love 2025.
* There was a Zig team retreat.
* There were several Zig Day events.

This year 2026: Proposal to renew $15k budget for travel.
* We expect more opportunities for travel in 2026 similar to those of 2024.

Votes on budget renewal:
* Andrew: Yes
* Josh: Yes
* Mason: Yes

## 2. Rules compliance

We reviewed the bylaws, and we believe we are in compliance.

## 3. Conflict of interest

We are still interested in adding a bylaw that prevents a board member from taking gifts and stuff that would create a conflict of interest of some kind.

Here's what we wrote up:

> Article VII - Incentive Transactions
> 
> Section 7.1 An "Incentive Transaction" is the same as an "Interested Party
> Transaction" except with a "Third Party" instead of "the Corporation", in which
> the Third Party has reasonable cause to want to influence the Zig Software
> Foundation in service of their financial goals. The same Procedures apply to
> Incentive Transactions.

Votes to append this bylaw:
* Andrew: Yes
* Josh: Yes
* Mason: Yes

## 4. Approve potential conflicts of interest

In accordance to the newly added "Article VII - Incentive Transactions" bylaw, we formally review existing potential conflicts of interest.

Andrew holds stock options in TigerBeetle.
* Josh: Approved
* Mason: Approved

Mason is an independent contractor for Tuple.
* Josh: Approved
* Andrew: Approved

The bylaw does not currently require such potential conflicts of interest be documented publicly like they are here, but these two instances here serve as an example of following the new procedure.
