    <h1>0.3.0 Release Notes</h1>
    <p>
    <a href="/download">Download &amp; Documentation</a>
    </p>
    <p>
    Zig is an open-source programming language designed for <strong>robustness</strong>,
    <strong>optimality</strong>, and <strong>clarity</strong>. Zig is aggressively pursuing
    its goal of overthrowing C as the de facto language for system programming. Zig intends
    to be so practical that people find themselves using it even if they dislike it.
    </p>
    <p>
    This is a <em>massive</em> release, featuring 6 months of work and
    changes from <strong>36 different contributors</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>I tried to give credit
    where credit is due, but it's inevitable I missed some contributions as I had
    to go through 1,345 commits to type up these release notes. I apologize in
    advance for any mistakes.
    </p>
    <p>
    Special thanks to my <a href="https://github.com/users/andrewrk/sponsorship">sponsors who provide financial support</a>. You're making Zig sustainable.
    </p>

   <h2 id="stack-traces">Stack Traces on All Targets</h2>
   <p>Zig uses LLVM's debug info API to emit native debugging information on all targets.
   This means that you can use native debugging tools on Zig code, for example:
   </p>
   <ul>
     <li>MSVC on Windows</li>
     <li>lldb on MacOS</li>
     <li>gdb and valgrind on Linux</li>
   </ul>
   <p>
   In addition, Zig's standard library can read its own native debug information. This
   means that crashes produce stack traces, and errors produce
   <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.3.0/#Error-Return-Traces">Error Return Traces</a>.
   </p>
   <h3 id="stack-traces-macos">MacOS</h3>
   <img src="stack-traces-macos.png">
   <p>This implementation is able to look at the executable's own memory to find out where the .o
   files are, which have the DWARF info.</p>
   <h3 id="stack-traces-windows">Windows</h3>
   <img src="stack-traces-windows.png">
   <p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Sahnvour">Sahnvour</a> for implementing the PE parsing
   and starting the effort to PDB parsing. I picked up where he left off and finished Windows stack traces.
   </p>
   <p>
   Thanks to Zachary Turner from the LLVM project for helping me understand the PDB format. I still owe
   LLVM some PDB documentation patches in return.
   </p>
   <p>Similar to MacOS, a Windows executable in memory has location information pointing to a .pdb file which
   contains debug information.</p>
   <h3 id="stack-traces-linux">Linux</h3>
   <img src="stack-traces-linux.png">
   <p>Linux stack traces worked in 0.2.0. However now {#syntax#}std.debug.dumpStackTrace{#endsyntax#} &amp; friends use {#syntax#}ArenaAllocator{#endsyntax#} backed by
   {#syntax#}DirectAllocator{#endsyntax#}. This has the downside of failing to print a stack trace
        when the system is out of memory, but for the more common use case when the system is not
        out of memory, but the debug info cannot fit in {#syntax#}std.debug.global_allocator{#endsyntax#},
        now stack traces will work. This is the case for the self hosted compiler.
   There is <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/907#issuecomment-415946565">a proposal</a> to
   <code>mmap()</code> debug info rather than using <code>read()</code>.
   </p>
   <p>See also <a href="#rosegment">Compatibility with Valgrind</a>.

   <h2 id="zig-fmt">zig fmt</h2>
   <p>
   Thanks to Jimmi Holst Christensen's diligent work, the Zig standard library now supports parsing Zig code.
   This API is used to implement <code>zig fmt</code>, a tool that reformats code to fit the
   canonical style.
   </p>
   <p>
   As an example, <code>zig fmt</code> will change this code:
   </p>
   <pre>{#syntax#}
test "fmt" {
const a = []u8{
    1, 2, //
    3,
    4, // foo
    5,
    6,
    7 };
         switch (0) { 0 => {}, 1 => unreachable, 2,
            3 => {}, 4...7 => {}, 1 + 4 * 3 + 22 => {}, else => { const a = 1; const b = a; }, }

    foo(a, b, c, d, e, f, g,);
}
{#endsyntax#}</pre>
   <p>
   ...into this code:
   </p>
<pre>{#syntax#}
test "fmt" {
    const a = []u8{
        1, 2,
        3, 4, // foo
        5, 6,
        7,
    };
    switch (0) {
        0 => {},
        1 => unreachable,
        2, 3 => {},
        4...7 => {},
        1 + 4 * 3 + 22 => {},
        else => {
            const a = 1;
            const b = a;
        },
    }

    foo(
        a,
        b,
        c,
        d,
        e,
        f,
        g,
    );
}
{#endsyntax#}</pre>
  <p>It does not make any decisions about line widths. That is left up to the user.
     However, it follows certain cues about when to line break. For example, it will put the
     same number of array items in a line as there are in the first one. And it will
     put a function call all on one line if there is no trailing comma, but break every
     parameter into its own line if there is a trailing comma.
    </p>
    <p>Thanks to Marc Tiehuis, there are currently two editor plugins that integrate with <code>zig fmt</code>:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig.vim">Vim</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/ziglang/vscode-zig">VSCode</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    <code>zig fmt</code> is only implemented in the self-hosted compiler,
    which is <a href="#stage2-progress">not finished yet</a>. To use it, one
    must follow the README instructions to build the self-hosted compiler from source.
    </p>
    <p>
    The
    <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/0.3.0/std/zig/parse.zig#L12">implementation of the self-hosted parser</a>
    is an interesting case study of avoiding recursion by using an explicit stack. It is essentially a
    hand-written recursive descent parser, but with heap allocations instead of recursion. When Jimmi
    originally implemented the code, we thought that we could not solve the unbounded stack growth problem
    of recursion. However, since then, I prototyped several solutions that provide the ability to have
    recursive function calls without giving up statically known upper bound stack growth. See
    <a href="#recursion">Recursion Status</a> for more details.
    </p>
    <p>Automatic formatting can be disabled in source files with a comment like this:</p>
    <pre>{#syntax#}
// zig fmt: off
test     "this is left alone"  {   }
// zig fmt: on
    {#endsyntax#}</pre>
    <p>
    <code>zig fmt</code> is written using the standard library's event-based I/O abstractions and
    {#syntax#}async{#endsyntax#}/{#syntax#}await{#endsyntax#} syntax, which means that it is
    multi-threaded with non-blocking I/O. A debug build of <code>zig fmt</code> on my laptop
    formats the entire Zig standard library in 2.1 seconds, which is 75,516 lines per second.
    See <a href="#concurrency">Concurrency Status</a> for more details.
    </p>

   <h2 id="zig-run">zig run</h2>
   <p>
   <code>zig run file.zig</code> can now be used to execute a file directly.
   </p>
   <p>Thanks to Marc Tiehuis for the initial implementation of this feature. Marc writes:</p>
   <p>
    On a POSIX system, a shebang can be used to run a zig file directly. An
    example shebang would be <code>#!/usr/bin/zig run</code>. You may not be able pass
    extra compile arguments currently as part of the shebang. Linux for example
    treats all arguments after the first as a single argument which will result
    in an 'invalid command'.
   </p>
   <p>Note: there is <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1505">a proposal</a>
   to change this to <code>zig file.zig</code> to match the interface of other languages,
   as well as enable the common pattern <code>#!/usr/bin/env zig</code>.</p>
   <p>
   Zig caches the binary generated by <code>zig run</code> so that subsequent invocations have low
   startup cost. See <a href="#caching">Build Artifact Caching</a> for more details.
   </p>

   <h2 id="static-builds">Automated Static Linux x86_64 Builds of Master Branch</h2>
   <p>Zig now supports building statically against <a href="https://www.musl-libc.org/">musl libc</a>.</p>
   <p>On every master branch push, the continuous integration server creates a static Linux build of zig
   and updates the URL <code>https://ziglang.org/builds/zig-linux-x86_64-master.tar.xz</code> to redirect to it.
   </p>
   <p>
   In addition, Zig now looks for libc and the Zig standard library at runtime. This makes static
   builds the easiest and most reliable way to start using the latest version of Zig immediately.
   </p>
   <p>
   Windows has automated static builds of master branch
   <a href="https://ci.appveyor.com/project/andrewrk/zig-d3l86/history">via AppVeyor</a>.
   </p>
   <p>
   MacOS static CI builds are
   <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1089">in progress</a>
   and should be available soon.
   </p>

   <h2 id="pointer-reform">Pointer Reform</h2>
   <p>During this release cycle, two design flaws were fixed, which led to a chain reaction
   of changes that I called Pointer Reform, resulting in a more consistent syntax with
   simpler semantics.</p>
   <p>The first design flaw was that the syntax for pointers was ambiguous if the pointed
   to type was a {#syntax#}type{#endsyntax#}. Consider this 0.2.0 code:</p>
   <pre>{#syntax#}
const assert = @import("std").debug.assert;

comptime {
    var a: i32 = 1;
    const b = &a;
    @compileLog(@typeOf(b));
    *b = 2;
    assert(a == 2);
}
{#endsyntax#}</pre>
   <p>This works fine. The value printed from the
   {#syntax#}@compileLog{#endsyntax#} statement is {#syntax#}&i32{#endsyntax#}.
   This makes sense because {#syntax#}b{#endsyntax#} is a pointer to {#syntax#}a{#endsyntax#}.</p>
   <p>Now let's do it with a {#syntax#}type{#endsyntax#}:</p>
   <pre>{#syntax#}
const assert = @import("std").debug.assert;

comptime {
    var a: type = i32;
    const b = &a;
    @compileLog(b);
    *b = f32;
    assert(a == f32);
}
{#endsyntax#}</pre>
<pre><code class="shell">$ zig build-obj test.zig 
| &amp;i32
<span class="t0_1">test.zig:6:5:</span> <span class="t31_1">error:</span> <span class="t0_1">found compile log statement</span>
    @compileLog(b);
    <span class="t32_1">^</span>
<span class="t0_1">test.zig:7:5:</span> <span class="t31_1">error:</span> <span class="t0_1">attempt to dereference non-pointer type 'type'</span>
    *b = f32;
    <span class="t32_1">^</span></code></pre>
<p>It doesn't work in 0.2.0, because the {#syntax#}&{#endsyntax#} operator worked differently for
{#syntax#}type{#endsyntax#} than other types. Here, {#syntax#}b{#endsyntax#} is the type {#syntax#}&i32{#endsyntax#} instead of a pointer to a type which is how we wanted to use it.</p>
<p>This prevented other things from working too; for example if you had a
{#syntax#}[]type{i32, u8, f64}{#endsyntax#} and you tried to use a for loop,
it crashed the compiler because internally a for loop uses the {#syntax#}&{#endsyntax#}
operator on the array element.</p>
   <p>The only reasonable solution to this is to have different syntax for the address-of operator and
   the pointer operator, rather than them both being {#syntax#}&{#endsyntax#}.</p>
   <p>So pointer syntax becomes {#syntax#}*T{#endsyntax#}, matching syntax from most other languages such as C.
   Address-of syntax remains {#syntax#}&foo{#endsyntax#}, again matching common address-of syntax such as in C.
   This leaves one problem though.</p>
   <p>With this modification, the syntax {#syntax#}*foo{#endsyntax#} becomes ambiguous with the syntax for
   dereferencing. And so dereferencing syntax is changed to a postfix operator: {#syntax#}foo.*{#endsyntax#}.
   This matches post-fix indexing syntax: {#syntax#}foo[0]{#endsyntax#}, and in practice ends up harmonizing
   nicely with other postfix operators.</p>
   <p>The other design flaw is a problem that has plagued C since its creation: the pointer type doesn't tell you how many items
   there are at the address. This is now fixed by having two kinds of pointers in Zig:</p>
   <ul>
     <li>{#syntax#}*T{#endsyntax#} - pointer to exactly one item.
       <ul>
         <li>Supports deref syntax: {#syntax#}ptr.*{#endsyntax#}</li>
       </ul>
     </li>
     <li>{#syntax#}[*]T{#endsyntax#} - pointer to unknown number of items.
       <ul>
         <li>Supports index syntax: {#syntax#}ptr[i]{#endsyntax#}</li>
         <li>Supports slice syntax: {#syntax#}ptr[start..end]{#endsyntax#}</li>
         <li>{#syntax#}T{#endsyntax#} must have a known size, which means that it cannot be
           {#syntax#}c_void{#endsyntax#} or any other {#syntax#}@OpaqueType(){#endsyntax#}.</li>
        </ul>
     </li>
   </ul>
   <p>Note that this causes pointers to arrays to fall into place, as a single-item pointer
   to an array acts as a pointer to a compile-time known number of items:</p>
   <ul>
     <li>{#syntax#}*[N]T{#endsyntax#} - pointer to N items, same as single-item pointer to array.
       <ul>
         <li>Supports index syntax: {#syntax#}array_ptr[i]{#endsyntax#}</li>
         <li>Supports slice syntax: {#syntax#}array_ptr[start..end]{#endsyntax#}</li>
         <li>Supports len property: {#syntax#}array_ptr.len{#endsyntax#}</li>
       </ul>
     </li>
   </ul>
   <p>Consider how slices fit into this picture:</p>
   <ul>
     <li>{#syntax#}[]T{#endsyntax#} - pointer to runtime-known number of items.
       <ul>
         <li>Supports index syntax: {#syntax#}slice[i]{#endsyntax#}</li>
         <li>Supports slice syntax: {#syntax#}slice[start..end]{#endsyntax#}</li>
         <li>Supports len property: {#syntax#}slice.len{#endsyntax#}</li>
       </ul>
     </li>
   </ul>
   <p>This makes Zig pointers significantly less error prone. For example, it fixed issue <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/386">#386</a>,
   which demonstrates how a pointer to an array in Zig 0.2.0 is a footgun when passed as a parameter.
   Meanwhile in 0.3.0, equivalent code is nearly impossible to get wrong.</p>
   <p>For consistency with the postfix pointer dereference operator, optional unwrapping syntax is
   now postfix as well:</p>
   <p>0.2.0: <code>??x</code></p>
   <p>0.3.0: {#syntax#}x.?{#endsyntax#}</p>
   <p>And finally, to remove the last inconsistency of optional syntax, the <code>??</code> operator
   is now the keyword {#syntax#}orelse{#endsyntax#}. This means that Zig now has the property that
   <strong>all control flow occurs exclusively via keywords</strong>.
   <p>
   There is <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/265">a plan for one more pointer type</a>,
   which is a pointer that has a null-terminated
   number of items. This would be the type of the parameter to <code>strlen</code> for example.
   Although this will make the language bigger by adding a new type, it allows Zig to delete a feature
   in exchange, since it will make
   <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.3.0/#C-String-Literals">C string literals</a> unnecessary.
   String literals will both have a compile-time known length and be null-terminated; therefore they
   will <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.3.0/#Implicit-Casts">implicitly cast</a> to 
   slices as well as null-terminated pointers.
   </p>
   <p>
   There is one new issue caused by Pointer Reform. Because C does not have the concept of
   single-item pointers or unknown-length pointers (or non-null pointers),
   Zig must translate all C pointers as {#syntax#}?[*]T{#endsyntax#}. That is, a pointer to
   an unknown number of items that might be null. This can cause some friction when using C APIs,
   which is unfortunate because Zig's types are perfectly compatible with C's types, but
   .h files are unable to adequately describe pointers. Although it would be much safer to
   translate .h files offline and fix their prototypes, there is
   <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1059">a proposal to add a C pointer type</a>.
   This new pointer type should never be used on purpose, but would be used when auto-translating C code.
   It would simply have C pointer semantics, which means it would be just as much of a footgun as C pointers are.
   The upside is that it would make interaction with C APIs go back to being perfectly seamless.
   </p>

   <h2 id="default-float-mode">Default Float Mode is now Strict</h2>
   <p>In response to an overwhelming consensus, floating point operations use Strict mode by default.
   Code can use <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.3.0/#setFloatMode">@setFloatMode</a> to
   override the mode on a per-scope basis.</p>
   <p>Thanks to Marc Tiehuis for implementing the change.</p>

   <h2 id="remove-this">Remove this</h2>
   <p><code>this</code> was always a weird language feature. An identifier which referred to the thing in the
   most immediate scope, which could be a module, a type, a function, or even a block of code.</p>
   <p>The main use case for it was for anonymous structs to refer to themselves. This use case is solved
   with a new builtin function, <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.3.0/#This">@This()</a>,
   which always returns the innermost struct or union that the builtin call is inside.</p>
   <p>The "block of code" type is removed from Zig, and the first argument of
   <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.3.0/#setFloatMode">@setFloatMode</a> is removed.
   {#syntax#}@setFloatMode{#endsyntax#} now always refers to the current scope.
   </p>

   <h2 id="casting-syntax">Remove Explicit Casting Syntax</h2>
   <p>Previously, these two lines would have different meanings:</p>
   <pre>{#syntax#}
export fn foo(x: u32) void {
    const a: u8 = x;
    const b = u8(x);
}
   {#endsyntax#}</pre>
   <p>The assignment to {#syntax#}a{#endsyntax#} would give <code>error: expected type 'u8', found 'u32'</code>,
   because not all values of {#syntax#}u32{#endsyntax#} can fit in a {#syntax#}u8{#endsyntax#}. But the
   assignment to {#syntax#}b{#endsyntax#} was "cast harder" syntax, and Zig would truncate bits,
   with a safety check to ensure that the mathematical meaning of the integer was preserved.
   </p><p>
   Now, both lines are identical in semantics. There is no more "cast harder" syntax.
   Both cause the compile error because implicit casts are only allowed when it is
   completely unambiguous how to get from one type to another, and the transformation is
   guaranteed to be safe. For other casts, Zig has builtin functions:
   </p>
   <ul>
     <li><a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.3.0/#bitCast">@bitCast</a> - change type but maintain bit representation</li>
     <li><a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.3.0/#alignCast">@alignCast</a> - make a pointer have more alignment</li>
     <li><a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.3.0/#boolToInt">@boolToInt</a> - convert true to 1 and false to 0</li>
     <li><a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.3.0/#bytesToSlice">@bytesToSlice</a> - convert a slice of bytes to a slice of another type</li>
     <li><a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.3.0/#enumToInt">@enumToInt</a> - obtain the integer tag value of an enum or tagged union</li>

   <p>
  Some are safe; some are not. Some perform language-level assertions; some do not.
  Some are no-ops at runtime; some are not. Each casting function is documented independently.
   </p>
   <p>
   Having explicit and fine-grained casting like this is a form of intentional redundancy.
   Casts are often the source of bugs, and therefore it is worth double-checking a cast to verify that
   it is still correct when the type of the operand changes. For example, imagine that we have the following
   code:
   </p>
   <pre>{#syntax#}
fn foo(x: i32) void {
    var i = @intCast(usize, x);
}
   {#endsyntax#}</pre>
   <p>
   Now consider what happens when the type of {#syntax#}x{#endsyntax#} changes to a pointer:
   <pre><code class="shell"><span class="t0_1">test.zig:2:29:</span> <span class="t31_1">error:</span> <span class="t0_1">expected integer type, found '*i32'</span>
    var i = @intCast(usize, x);
                            <span class="t32_1">^</span></code></pre>
   Although we technically know how to convert a pointer to an integer,
   because we used {#syntax#}@intCast{#endsyntax#}, we are forced to inspect the cast and change
   it appropriately. Perhaps that means changing it to {#syntax#}@ptrToInt{#endsyntax#}, or perhaps
   the entire function needs to be reworked in response to the type change.
   </p>

   <h2 id="parameter-passing">Direct Parameter Passing</h2>
   <p>
   Previously, it was illegal to pass structs and unions by value in non-{#syntax#}extern{#endsyntax#}
   functions. Instead, one would have to have the function accept a {#syntax#}const{#endsyntax#} pointer
   parameter. This was to avoid the ambiguity that C programs face - having to make the decision about
   whether by-value or by-reference was better. However, there were some problems with this. For example,
   when the parameter type is inferred, Zig would automatically convert to a {#syntax#}const{#endsyntax#}
   pointer. This caused problems in generic code, which could not distinguish between a type which is
   a pointer, and a type which has been automatically converted to a pointer.
   </p>
   <p>
   Now, parameters can be passed directly:
   </p>
   <pre>{#syntax#}
const assert = @import("std").debug.assert;

const Foo = struct {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
};

fn callee(foo: Foo) void {
    assert(foo.y == 2);
}

test "pass directly" {
    callee(Foo{ .x = 1, .y = 2 });
}
   {#endsyntax#}</pre>
   <p>
   I have avoided using the term "by-value" because the semantics of this kind of parameter passing
   are different:
   </p>
   <ul>
     <li>Zig is free to pass the parameter by value - perhaps if it is smaller than some number of bytes -
       or pass it by reference.</li>
     <li>To the callee, the value appears to be a value and is immutable.</li>
     <li>The caller guarantees that the bytes of the parameter will not change for the duration of the
       call. This means that it is unsound to pass a global variable in this way if that global variable
      is mutated by the callee. There is an
      <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/476">open issue</a>
      which explores adding runtime safety checks for this.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>
   Because of these semantics, there's a clear flow chart for whether to accept a parameter as
   {#syntax#}T{#endsyntax#} or {#syntax#}*const T{#endsyntax#}:
   </p>
   <ul>
     <li>Use {#syntax#}T{#endsyntax#}, unless one of the following is true:
       <ul>
         <li>The function depends on the address of the parameter.</li>
         <li>The parameter <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1108">may alias</a>
           another parameter or global variable.</li>
       </ul>
     </li>
   </ul>
   <p>Now that we have this kind of parameter passing, Zig's implicit cast
   from {#syntax#}T{#endsyntax#} to {#syntax#}*const T{#endsyntax#} is less important.
   One might even make the case that such a cast is dangerous. Therefore we have
   <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1465">a proposal to remove it</a>.
   </p>
   <p>
   There is one more area that needs consideration with regards to direct parameter passing,
   and that is with coroutines. The problem is that if a reference to a stack variable is
   passed to a coroutine, it may become invalid after the coroutine suspends.
   This is a <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1592">design flaw</a> in Zig that will
   be addressed in a future version. See <a href="#concurrency">Concurrency Status</a> for more details.
   </p>
   <p>Note that {#syntax#}extern{#endsyntax#} functions are bound by the C ABI,
   and therefore none of this applies to them.</p>

   <h2 id="rand-funcs">Rewrite Rand Functions</h2>
   <p>Marc Tiehuis writes:</p>
   <p>
    We now use a generic Rand structure which abstracts the core functions
    from the backing engine.
   </p>
   <p>
    The old Mersenne Twister engine is removed and replaced instead with
    three alternatives:
   </p>
   <ul>
     <li>Pcg32</li>
     <li>Xoroshiro128+</li>
     <li>Isaac64</li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    These should provide sufficient coverage for most purposes, including a
    CSPRNG using Isaac64. Consumers of the library that do not care about
    the actual engine implementation should use <code>DefaultPrng</code> and <code>DefaultCsprng</code>.
   </p>

   <h2 id="async-err-ret-traces">Error Return Traces across async/await</h2>
   <p>One of the problems with non-blocking programming is that stack traces
   and exceptions are less useful, because the actual stack trace points back
   to the event loop code.
   </p>
   <p>
   In Zig 0.3.0, <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.3.0/#Error-Return-Traces">Error Return Traces</a>
   work across suspend points. This means you can use {#syntax#}try{#endsyntax#} as the main
   error handling strategy, and when an error bubbles up all the way, you'll still be able to find out
   where it came from:
   </p>

Tests failed. Use the following command to reproduce the failure:
zig-cache/test
</code></pre>
<p>Note that this output contains 3 components:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>An error message: <code>attempt to unwrap error: FileNotFound</code></li>
      <li>An error return trace. The error was first returned at <code>fs.zig:367:5</code>
        and then returned at <code>fs.zig:374:13</code>. You could go look at those source locations
        for more information.</li>
      <li>A stack trace. Once the error came back from <code>openRead</code>, the code tried to
        {#syntax#}catch unreachable{#endsyntax#} which caused the panic. You can see that the stack
        trace does, in fact, go into the event loop as described above.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>It is important to note in this example, that the error return trace survived despite
    the fact that the event loop is multi-threaded, and any one of those threads could be the worker
    thread that resumes an async function at the {#syntax#}await{#endsyntax#} point.

   <h2 id="async-call-syntax">New Async Call Syntax</h2>
   <p>Instead of <code>async(allocator) call()</code>, now it is
   <code>async&lt;allocator&gt; call()</code>.
   </p>
   <p>This fixes syntax ambiguity when leaving off the allocator,
   and fixes parse failure when call is a field access.</p>
   <p>This sets a precedent for using <code>&lt;</code> <code>&gt;</code> to pass arguments
   to a keyword. This will affect <code>enum</code>, <code>union</code>, <code>fn</code>, and

   This kicks open the door for compile-time reflection, especially when combined with the fact that
   Jimmi Holst Christensen implemented <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.3.0/#field">@field</a>,
   which performs field access with a compile-time known name:
   <pre>{#syntax#}
const std = @import("std");
const assert = std.debug.assert;

test "@field" {
    const Foo = struct {
        one: i32,
        two: bool,
    };
    var f = Foo{
        .one = 42,
        .two = true,
    };

    const names = [][]const u8{ "two", "one" };

    assert(@field(f, names[0]) == true);
    assert(@field(f, names[1]) == 42);

    @field(f, "one") += 1;
    assert(@field(f, "on" ++ "e") == 43);
}
   {#endsyntax#}</pre>
   <p>This has the potential to be abused, and so the feature should be used carefully.</p>
   <p>After Jimmi implemented {#syntax#}@field{#endsyntax#}, he improved the implementation of 
   {#syntax#}@typeInfo{#endsyntax#} and fixed several bugs. And now, the combination of
   these builtins is used to implement struct printing in userland:</p>
   <pre>{#syntax#}
const std = @import("std");

const Foo = struct {
    one: i32,
    two: *u64,
    three: bool,
};

pub fn main() void {
    var x: u64 = 1234;
    var f = Foo{
        .one = 42,
        .two = &x,
        .three = false,
    };

    std.debug.warn("here it is: {}\n", f);
}
   {#endsyntax#}</pre>
   <p>Output:</p>
   <pre><code>here it is: Foo{ .one = 42, .two = u64@7ffdda208cf0, .three = false }</code></pre>
   <p>See <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/0.3.0/std/fmt/index.zig#L15">std/fmt/index.zig:15</a>
   for the implementation.</p>
   <p>
   Now that we have {#syntax#}@typeInfo{#endsyntax#}, there is one more question to answer:
   should there be a function which accepts a {#syntax#}TypeInfo{#endsyntax#} value, and makes
   a type out of it?
   </p>
   <p>
   This hypothetical feature is called <code>@reify</code>, and it's a
   <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/383">hot topic</a>. Although undeniably powerful and
   useful, there is concern that it would be <em>too</em> powerful, leading to complex meta-programming
   that goes against the spirit of simplicity that Zig stands for.</p>

   <h2 id="cmpxchg">Improve cmpxchg</h2>
   <p><code>@cmpxchg</code> is removed. <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.3.0/#cmpxchgStrong">@cmpxchgStrong</a> and <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.3.0/#cmpxchgWeak">@cmpxchgWeak</a> are added.
   <p>The functions have operand type as the first parameter.</p>
   <p>The return type is <code>?T</code> where <code>T</code> is the operand type.</p>

   <h2 id="f16">New Type: f16</h2>
   <p>Ben Noordhuis implemented {#syntax#}f16{#endsyntax#}. This is guaranteed to be
    IEEE-754-2008 binary16 format, even on systems that have no hardware support,
    thanks to the additions to compiler_rt that Ben contributed. He also added support
    for {#syntax#}f16{#endsyntax#} to <code>std.math</code> functions such as <code>isnormal</code>
    and <code>fabs</code>.
   </p>

   <h2 id="int-sizes">All Integer Sizes are Primitives</h2>
   <p>Zig 0.2.0 had primitive types for integer bit widths of 2-8, 16, 29, 32, 64, 128.
   Any number other than that, and you had to use <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.3.0/#IntType">@IntType</a> to create the type.
   But you would get a compile error if you shadowed one of the above bit widths that already existed, for example with
   <pre>{#syntax#}
const u29 = @IntType(false, 29); // error: u29 shadows primitive type
   {#endsyntax#}</pre>
   </p>
   <p>Needless to say, this situation was unnecessarily troublesome (<a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/745">#745</a>). And so now
    arbitrary bit-width integers can be referenced by using an identifier of
    <code>i</code> or <code>u</code> followed by digits. For example, the identifier
    {#syntax#}i7{#endsyntax#} refers to a signed 7-bit integer. 
   </p>
   <p>
   {#syntax#}u0{#endsyntax#} is a 0-bit type, which means:</p>
   <ul>
     <li>{#syntax#}@sizeOf(u0) == 0{#endsyntax#}</li>
     <li>No actual code is generated for loads and stores of this type of value.</li>
     <li>The value of a {#syntax#}u0{#endsyntax#} as always the compile-time known value of {#syntax#}0{#endsyntax#}.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>
   {#syntax#}i0{#endsyntax#} <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1593">doesn't make sense</a>
   and will probably crash the compiler.
   </p>
   <p>
   Although Zig defines arbitrary integer sizes to support all primitive operations, if you try to use,
   for example, multiplication on 256-bit integers:
   </p>
   <pre>{#syntax#}
test "large multiplication" {
    var x: u256 = 0xabcd;
    var y: u256 = 0xefef;
    var z = x * y;
}
   {#endsyntax#}</pre>
   <p>Then you'll get an error like this:</p>
   <pre>LLVM ERROR: Unsupported library call operation!</pre>
   <p>
   Zig isn't supposed to be letting LLVM leak through here, but that's a separate issue.
   What's happening is that normally if a primitive operation such as multiplication of
   integers cannot be lowered to a machine instruction, LLVM will emit a library call to
   compiler_rt to perform the operation. This works for up to 128-bit multiplication,
   for example. However compiler_rt does not define an arbitrary precision multiplication
   library function, and so LLVM is not able to generate code.
   </p>
   <p>It <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1534">is planned</a> to submit a patch
   to LLVM which adds the ability to emit a lib call for situations like this, and then
   Zig will include the arbitrary precision multiplication function in Zig's compiler_rt.</p>
   <p>In addition to this, Zig 0.3.0 fixes
   <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1242">a bug</a> where
   {#syntax#}@IntType{#endsyntax#} was silently wrapping the bit count parameter if it was greater
   than pow(2, 32).

    </ul>

   <h2 id="caching">Build Artifact Caching</h2>
   <p>Zig now supports global build artifact caching. This feature is one of those things that
   you can generally ignore, because it "just works" without any babysitting.</p>
   <p>By default, compilations are not cached. You can enable the global cache for a compilation
   by using <code>--cache on</code>:</p>
   <pre><code>andy@xps:~/tmp$ time zig build-exe hello.zig 

real	0m0.414s
user	0m0.369s
sys	0m0.049s
andy@xps:~/tmp$ time zig build-exe hello.zig --cache on
/home/andy/.local/share/zig/stage1/artifact/hkGO0PyaOKDrdg2wyhV1vRy0ATyTaT0s0ECa2BiHFJfsb9RDVKK_r3qwHI5gaEfv/hello

real	0m0.412s
user	0m0.377s
sys	0m0.038s
andy@xps:~/tmp$ time zig build-exe hello.zig --cache on
/home/andy/.local/share/zig/stage1/artifact/hkGO0PyaOKDrdg2wyhV1vRy0ATyTaT0s0ECa2BiHFJfsb9RDVKK_r3qwHI5gaEfv/hello

real	0m0.012s
user	0m0.009s
sys	0m0.003s</code></pre>
   <p>When the cache is on, the output is not written to the current directory. Instead, the output
   is kept in the cache directory, and the path to it is printed to stdout.</p>
   <p>This is off by default, because this is an uncommon use case. The real benefit of build artifact
   caching comes in 3 places:</p>
   <ul>
     <li><a href="#zig-run">zig run</a>, where it is enabled by default:
     <pre><code>andy@xps:~/tmp$ time zig run hello.zig 
Hello, world!

real	0m0.553s
user	0m0.500s
sys	0m0.055s
andy@xps:~/tmp$ time zig run hello.zig 
Hello, world!

real	0m0.013s
user	0m0.007s
sys	0m0.006s</code></pre>
     </li>
     <li><a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.3.0/#Zig-Build-System">zig build</a>, so that your build
       script only has to build once.</li>
     <li>
       When building an executable or shared library, Zig must build <code>compiler_rt.o</code> and
       <code>builtin.o</code> from source, for the given target. This usually only has to be done
       once ever, which is why other compilers such as gcc ship with these components already built.
       The problem with that strategy is that you have to build a special version of the compiler for
       cross-compiling. With Zig, you can always build for any target, on any target.
       <br><br>
       So caching these artifacts provides a happy solution.
     </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
   The cache is perfect; there are no false positives. You could even fix a bug in <code>memcpy</code>
   in the system's libc, and Zig will detect that its own code has (indirectly) been updated,
   and invalidate the cache entry.
   </p>
   <p>
   If you use <code>zig build-exe</code>, Zig will still create a <code>zig-cache</code> directory
   in the current working directory in order to store an intermediate <code>.o</code> file.
   This is because on MacOS, the intermediate .o file stores the debug information, and therefore
   it needs to stick around somewhere sensible for <a href="#stack-traces">Stack Traces</a> to work.
   </p>
   <p>
   Likewise, if you use <code>zig test</code>, Zig will put the test binary in the <code>zig-cache</code>
   directory in the current working directory. It's useful to leave the test binary here so that the
   programmer can use a debugger on it or otherwise inspect it.
   </p>
   <p>The <code>zig-cache</code> directory <em>is</em> cleaner than before, however. For example, the
   <code>builtin.zig</code> file is no longer created there. It participates in the global caching system,
   just like <code>compiler_rt.o</code>. You can use <code>zig builtin</code> to see the contents of
   {#syntax#}@import("builtin"){#endsyntax#}.</p>

   <h2 id="rosegment">Compatibility with Valgrind</h2>
   <p>I noticed that valgrind does not see Zig's debug symbols (<a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/896">#896</a>):</p>
   <pre>{#syntax#}
pub fn main() void {
    foo().* += 1;
}

fn foo() *i32 {
    return @intToPtr(*i32, 10000000);
}
   {#endsyntax#}</pre><pre><code>==24133== Invalid read of size 4

==24133==    by 0x22236F: ??? (in /home/andy/downloads/zig/build/test)</code></pre>
   <p>After digging around, I was able to reproduce the problem using only Clang and LLD:</p>
   <pre><code>static int *foo(void) {
    return (int *)10000000;
}

int main(void) {
    int *x = foo();
    *x += 1;
}</code></pre>
   <p>If this C code is built with Clang and linked with LLD, Valgrind has the same issue
   as with the Zig code.</p>
   <p>I sent <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/valgrind/mailman/message/36286103/">a message</a>
   to the Valgrind mailing list, and they
   <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/valgrind/mailman/message/36286122/">suggested</a>
   submitting a bug fix to Valgrind.
   That's a good idea. I'm a little busy with Zig development though - anybody else want to take
   a crack at it?
   </p>
   <p>
   In the meantime, Zig now has a <code>--no-rosegment</code> flag, which works around the bug.
   It should only be used for this purpose; the flag will likely be removed once Valgrind fixes
   the issue upstream and enough time passes that the new version becomes generally available.
   </p>
   <pre><code>$ zig build-exe test.zig --no-rosegment
$ valgrind ./test

   <h2 id="godbolt">Zig is now on Godbolt Compiler Explorer</h2>
   <p>Marc Tiehuis added Zig support, and then worked with the
   <a href="https://github.com/mattgodbolt/compiler-explorer/">Compiler Explorer</a> team to get it
   merged upstream and deployed.</p>

   </ul>
   <p>The command line API that Compiler Explorer uses is covered by Zig's main test suite
   to ensure that it continues working as the language evolves.</p>

   <h2 id="zig-init">zig init-lib and init-exe</h2>
   <p><code>zig init-lib</code> can be used to initialize a
   <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.3.0/#Zig-Build-System">zig build</a>
   project in the current directory which will create a simple library:</p>
   <pre>$ zig init-lib
Created build.zig
Created src/main.zig

Next, try `zig build --help` or `zig build test`
$ zig build test
Test 1/1 basic add functionality...OK
All tests passed.</pre>
   <p>Likewise, <code>zig init-exe</code> initializes a simple application:</p>
   <pre>$ zig init-exe
Created build.zig
Created src/main.zig

Next, try `zig build --help` or `zig build run`
$ zig build run
All your base are belong to us.</pre>
   <p>The main Zig test suite tests this functionality so that it will not regress as Zig continues to evolve.</p>

   <h2 id="concurrency">Concurrency Status</h2>
   <p>
   Concurrency is now solved. That is, there is a concrete plan for how concurrency will work in Zig,
   and now it's a matter of implementing all the pieces.
   </p>
   <p>
   First and foremost, Zig supports low-level control over hardware.
   That means that it has atomic primitives:
   </p>
   <ul>
     <li><a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.3.0/#atomicLoad">@atomicLoad</a></li>
     <li><a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.3.0/#atomicRmw">@atomicRmw</a></li>
     <li><a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.3.0/#cmpxchgStrong">@cmpxchgStrong</a></li>
     <li><a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.3.0/#cmpxchgWeak">@cmpxchgWeak</a></li>
     <li><a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.3.0/#fence">@fence</a></li>
   </ul>
   <p>...and it means that you can directly spawn kernel threads using standard library functions:</p>
   <pre>{#syntax#}
const std = @import("std");
const assert = std.debug.assert;
const builtin = @import("builtin");
const AtomicRmwOp = builtin.AtomicRmwOp;
const AtomicOrder = builtin.AtomicOrder;

test "spawn threads" {
    var shared_ctx: i32 = 1;

    const thread1 = try std.os.spawnThread({}, start1);
    const thread2 = try std.os.spawnThread(&shared_ctx, start2);
    const thread3 = try std.os.spawnThread(&shared_ctx, start2);
    const thread4 = try std.os.spawnThread(&shared_ctx, start2);

    thread1.wait();
    thread2.wait();
    thread3.wait();
    thread4.wait();

    assert(shared_ctx == 4);
}

fn start1(ctx: void) u8 {
    return 0;
}

fn start2(ctx: *i32) u8 {
    _ = @atomicRmw(i32, ctx, AtomicRmwOp.Add, 1, AtomicOrder.SeqCst);
    return 0;
}
   {#endsyntax#}</pre>
   <p>
   On POSIX targets, when you link against libc, the standard library uses
   pthreads; otherwise it uses its own lightweight kernel thread implementation.
   </p>
   <p>You can use mutexes, signals, condition variables, and all those things.
   Anything you can accomplish in C, you can accomplish in Zig.</p>
   <p>
   However, the standard library provides a higher level concurrency abstraction,
   designed for optimal performance, debuggability, and structuring code to closely
   model the problems that concurrency presents.
   </p>
   <p>
   The abstraction is built on two language features: stackless coroutines and
   {#syntax#}async{#endsyntax#}/{#syntax#}await{#endsyntax#}
   syntax. Everything else is implemented in userland.
   </p>
   <p>
   {#syntax#}std.event.Loop{#endsyntax#} creates a kernel thread pool matching the number
   of logical CPUs. It can then be used for non-blocking I/O that will be dispatched across
   the thread pool, using the platform-native API:
   </p>
   <ul>
     <li>Windows - <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/FileIO/i-o-completion-ports">I/O Completion Ports</a></li>
     <li>MacOS - <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/kqueue.2">kqueue</a></li>
     <li>Linux - <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/epoll.7.html">epoll</a></li>
   </ul>
   <p>This is a competitor to <a href="http://libuv.org/">libuv</a>, except multi-threaded.</p>
   <p>
   Once you have an event loop, all of the {#syntax#}std.event{#endsyntax#} API becomes available to use:
   </p>
   <ul>
     <li>{#syntax#}std.event.Channel{#endsyntax#} - Many producer, many consumer, thread-safe, runtime configurable buffer size.
When buffer is empty, consumers suspend and are resumed by producers. When buffer is full, producers suspend and are resumed by consumers.</li>
     <li>{#syntax#}std.event.Future{#endsyntax#} - A value that many consumers can {#syntax#}await{#endsyntax#}.</li>
     <li>{#syntax#}std.event.Group{#endsyntax#} - A way to {#syntax#}await{#endsyntax#} multiple {#syntax#}async{#endsyntax#} operations.</li>
     <li>{#syntax#}std.event.Lock{#endsyntax#} - Ensures only one thread gets access to a resource, without blocking a kernel thread.</li>
     <li>{#syntax#}std.event.RwLock{#endsyntax#} - Same as Lock except allows multiple readers to access data simultaneously.</li>
     <li>{#syntax#}std.event.fs{#endsyntax#} - File system operations based on
       {#syntax#}async{#endsyntax#}/{#syntax#}await{#endsyntax#} syntax.
     </li>
     <li>{#syntax#}std.event.tcp{#endsyntax#} - Network operations based on
       {#syntax#}async{#endsyntax#}/{#syntax#}await{#endsyntax#} syntax.
     </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
   All of these abstractions provide convenient APIs based on 
   {#syntax#}async{#endsyntax#}/{#syntax#}await{#endsyntax#}
   syntax, making it practical for API users to model their code with maximally efficient concurrency.
   None of these abstractions block or use mutexes; when an API user must suspend, control flow
   goes to the next coroutine waiting to run, if any. If no coroutines are waiting to run,
   the application will sit idly, waiting for an event from the respective platform-native API
   (e.g. epoll on Linux).
   </p>
   <p>
   As an example, here is a snippet from a test in the standard library:
   </p>
   <pre>{#syntax#}
async fn testFsWatch(loop: *Loop) !void {
    const file_path = try os.path.join(loop.allocator, test_tmp_dir, "file.txt");
    defer loop.allocator.free(file_path);

    const contents =
        \\line 1
        \\line 2
    ;
    const line2_offset = 7;

    // first just write then read the file
    try await try async fs.writeFile(loop, file_path, contents);

    const read_contents = try await try async fs.readFile(loop, file_path, 1024 * 1024);
    assert(mem.eql(u8, read_contents, contents));

    // now watch the file
    var watch = try fs.Watch(void).create(loop, 0);
    defer watch.destroy();

    assert((try await try async watch.addFile(file_path, {})) == null);

    const ev = try async watch.channel.get();
    var ev_consumed = false;
    defer if (!ev_consumed) cancel ev;

    // overwrite line 2
    const fd = try await try async fs.openReadWrite(loop, file_path, os.File.default_mode);
    {
        defer os.close(fd);

        try await try async fs.pwritev(loop, fd, [][]const u8{"lorem ipsum"}, line2_offset);
    }

    ev_consumed = true;
    switch ((try await ev).id) {
        WatchEventId.CloseWrite => {},
        WatchEventId.Delete => @panic("wrong event"),
    }
    const contents_updated = try await try async fs.readFile(loop, file_path, 1024 * 1024);
    assert(mem.eql(u8, contents_updated,
        \\line 1
        \\lorem ipsum
    ));
}
   {#endsyntax#}</pre>
   <p>
   You can see that even though Zig is a language with manual memory management that insists on handling
   every possible error, it manages to be quite high level using these event-based APIs.
   </p>
   <p>
   Now, there are some problems to solve:
   </p>
   <ul>
     <li><a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1363">The way that canceling a coroutine works is currently unsound.</a> - I know how to fix this, but it'll have to be in 0.4.0. Unfortunately it's causing occasional
     test failures.
     </li>
     <li>
       <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1260">Lack of a guarantee about whether an async function call allocates memory or not.</a> - In theory, there are many cases where Zig should be able to guarantee that
       an async function call will not allocate memory for the coroutine frame. However in practice, using
       LLVM's coroutines API, it will always result in an allocation.
     </li>
     <li><a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/802">LLVM's coroutines implementation is buggy</a> -
       Right now Zig sadly is forced to disable optimizations for {#syntax#}async{#endsyntax#} functions because 
       LLVM has <a href="https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=36578">a bug</a>
       where Mem2Reg turns correct coroutine frame spills back into incorrect
       parameter references.
     </li>
     <li><strong>LLVM's coroutines implementation is slow</strong> - When I analyzed the compilation
     speed of Zig, even with optimizations off, LLVM takes up over 80% of the time. And for the zig behavioral
     tests, even though coroutines are a tiny percent of the code, LLVM's coroutine splitting pass takes
     up 30% of that time.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>
   And so, the plan is to rework coroutines, without using any of LLVM's coroutines API. Zig will implement
   coroutines in the frontend, and LLVM will see only functions and structs. This is
   <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2394-async_await.md">how Rust does it</a>,
   and I think it was a strong choice.
   </p>
   <p>
   The coroutine frame will be in a struct, and so Zig will know the size of it at compile-time, and
   it will solve the problem of guaranteeing allocation elision - the {#syntax#}async{#endsyntax#} callsite
   will simply have to provide the coroutine frame pointer in order to create the promise.
   </p>
   <p>
   This will also be relevant for recursion; stackless function calls do not count against the
   static stack size upper bound calculation. See <a href="#recursion">Recursion Status</a> for
   more details.
   </p>

   <h2 id="stage2-progress">Self-Hosted Compiler Status</h2>
   <p>The self-hosted compiler is well underway.
   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Pm29crq6Q">Here's a 1 minute demo of the self-hosted compiler watching source files and rebuilding.</a>
   </p>
   <p>
   The self-hosted compiler cannot do much more than Hello World at the moment, but
   it's being constructed from the ground up to fully take advantage of multiple cores
   and in-memory caching. In addition, Zig's error system and other safety features
   are making it easy to write reliable, robust code. Between stack traces, error return
   traces, and runtime safety checks, I barely even need a debugger.
   </p>
   <p>
   Marc Tiehuis contributed a <a href="https://tiehuis.github.io/blog/zig2.html">Big Integer library</a>,
   which the self-hosted compiler is using for integer literals and compile-time math operations.
   </p>
   <p>
   Writing the self-hosted compiler code revealed to me how coroutines should work in Zig.
   All the little details and ergonomics are clear to me now. And so before I continue any further on the
   self-hosted compiler, I will use this knowledge to rework coroutines and solve the problems with them.
   See <a href="#concurrency">Concurrency Status</a> for more details.
   </p>
   <p>As a reminder, even when the self-hosted compiler is complete, Zig will forever be stuck
   with the stage1 C++ compiler code. See <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/853">The Grand Bootstrapping Plan</a> for more details.</p>
   <p>
   The self-hosted compiler is successfully sharing some C++ code with the stage1 compiler.
   For example the libLLVM C++ API wrapper is built into a static library, which then exports a C API wrapper.
   The self-hosted compiler links against this static library in order to make libLLVM C++ API calls via the 
   C API wrapper. In addition, the Microsoft Visual Studio detection code requires the Windows COM API,
   which is also C++, and so a similar strategy is used. I think it's pretty neat that the build system
   builds a static library once and then ends up linking against it twice - one for each of the two compiler stages!
   </p>

   <h2 id="recursion">Recursion Status</h2>
   <p>
   I've <a href="https://www.recurse.com/events/localhost-andrew-kelley">said before</a> that
   recursion is one of the enemies of perfect software, because it represents a way that a
   program can fail with no foolproof way of preventing it. With recursion, pick any stack size
   and I'll give you an input that will crash your program. Embedded developers are all too
   familiar with this problem.
   </p>
   <p>
   It's always possible to rewrite code using an explicit stack using heap allocations,
   and <a href="#zig-fmt">that's exactly what Jimmi did</a> in the self-hosted parser.
   </p>
   <p>
   On the other hand, when recursion fits the problem, it's significantly more clear and
   maintainable. It would be a real shame to have to give it up.
   </p>
   <p>
   I researched different ways that Zig could keep recursion, even when we
   introduce <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/157">statically known stack upper bound size</a>. 
   I came up with a proof of concept for
   <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.3.0/#newStackCall">@newStackCall</a>,
   a builtin function that calls a function using an explicitly provided new stack.
   You can find a usage example in the documentation by following that link.
   </p>
   <p>
   This works, and it does break call graph cycles, but it would be a little bit awkward to use.
   Because if you allocate an entire new stack, it has to be big enough for the rest of the
   stack upper bound size, but in a recursive call, which should be only one stack frame,
   it would overallocate every time.
   </p>
   <p>
   So that's why I think that the actual solution to this problem is Zig's stackless coroutines.
   Because Zig's coroutines are stackless, they are the perfect solution for recursion (direct
   or indirect). With the reworking of coroutines, it will be possible to put the coroutine
   frame of an async function anywhere - in a struct, in the stack, in a global variable -
   as long as it outlives the duration of the coroutine. See <a href="#concurrency">Concurrency</a>
   for more details.

   <p>
   Although recursion is not yet solved, we know enough to know that recursion is OK to use in Zig.
   It does suffer from the stack overflow issue today, but in the future we will have a compile error
   to prevent call graph cycles. And then this hypothetical compile error will be solved by using
   {#syntax#}@newStackCall{#endsyntax#} or stackless functions (but probably stackless functions).
   Once recursion is solved, if stackless functions turn out to be the better solution,
   Zig will remove {#syntax#}@newStackCall{#endsyntax#} from the language, unless someone demonstrates
   a compelling use case for it.
   </p>
   <p>For now, use recursion whenever you want; you'll know when it's time to update your code.</p>

   <h2 id="wasm">WebAssembly Status</h2>
   <p>The pieces for web assembly are starting to come together.</p>
   <p>Ben Noordhuis fixed support for <code>--target-arch wasm32</code> (<a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1094">#1094</a>).</p>
   <p>LLVM <a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D43211">merged my patch</a> to make WebAssembly
   a normal (non-experimental) target. But they didn't do it before the LLVM 7 release. So
   Zig 0.3.0 will not have WebAssembly support by default, but 0.4.0 will.</p>
   <p>
   That being said, the static builds of Zig provided by ziglang.org have the WebAssembly
   target enabled.
   </p>
   <p>
   Apart from this, there appears to be
   <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1570">an issue with Zig's WebAssembly linker</a>.
   Once this is solved, all that is left is to use WebAssembly in real life use cases, to work
   out the ergonomics, and solve the inevitable issues that arise.
   </p>

   <h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>
   <p>
   The language reference documentation now contains no JavaScript. The code blocks
   are pre-formatted with <code>std.zig.Tokenizer</code>. The same is true for these
   release notes.
   </p>
   <p>
   The <code>builtin.zig</code> example code in the documentation is now automatically updated from
   the output of Zig, so the docs can't get out of date for this.
   </p>

     <li><code>std.os.Dir</code> gains Windows support.</li>
     <li><code>std.os.File.access</code> no longer depends on shlwapi.dll on Windows.</li>
     <li><code>std.os.path.dirname</code> returns null instead of empty slice when there
       is no directory component. This makes it harder to write bugs. (<a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1017">#1017</a>)
      </li>
      <li>Reading from a file can return <code>error.IsDir</code>.</li>
      <li>Added <code>std.math.floatMantissaBits</code> and <code>std.math.floatExponentBits</code> -Marc Tiehuis</li>
      <li><code>std.mem.Allocator</code> allows allocation of any 0 sized type, not just <code>void</code>. -Jimmi Holst Christensen.</li>
      <li>Added <code>std.os.cpuCount</code></li>
      <li>Added <code>std.sort.asc</code> and <code>std.sort.desc</code> -Marc Tiehuis</li>
      <li><code>std.fmt.format</code> add <code>*</code> for formatting things as pointers. (<a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1285">#1285</a>)</li>
      <li><code>std.fmt.format</code> add integer binary output format. -Marc Tiehuis (<a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1313">#1313</a>)</li>
      <li>Added <code>std.mem.secureZero</code>. -Marc Tiehuis
        <br><br>
        This is identical to <code>mem.set(u8, slice, 0)</code> except that it will never
    be optimized out by the compiler. Intended usage is for clearing
    secret data.
        <br><br>
    The resulting assembly has been manually verified in --release-* modes.
        <br><br>
    It would be valuable to test the 'never be optimized out' claim in tests
    but this is harder than initially expected due to how much Zig appears
    to know locally. May be doable with <code>@intToPtr</code>, <code>@ptrToInt</code> to get around
    known data dependencies but I could not work it out right now.
      </li>
      <li><code>std.fmt.format</code> handles non-pointer struct/union/enums. Adds support for printing structs
        via reflection. (<a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1380">#1380</a>)</li>
      <li>Many <code>std.os</code> file functions no longer require an allocator. They rely on
        <code>PATH_MAX</code>, because even Windows, Linux, and MacOS syscalls will fail for paths longer
        than <code>PATH_MAX</code>.</li>
      <li>Add <code>std.crypto.chaCha20IETF</code> and <code>std.crypto.chaCha20With64BitNonce</code>. -Shawn Landden &amp; Marc Tiehuis</li>
      <li>Add poly1305 and x25519 crypto primitives. -Marc Tiehuis
        <br><br>
        These are translated from <a href="https://monocypher.org/">monocypher</a> which
        has fairly competitive performance while remaining quite simple.
        <br><br>
        Initial performance comparision:
        <br>
        <pre>Zig:
  Poly1305: 1423 MiB/s
  X25519:   8671 exchanges per second

Monocypher:
  Poly1305: 1567 MiB/s
  X25519:   10539 exchanges per second</pre>
        There is room for improvement and no real effort has been made at all in
        optimization beyond a direct translation.
      </li>
      <li>Removed deprecated, unused Windows functions
        <ul>
          <li><code>std.os.windows.CryptAcquireContextA</code></li>
          <li><code>std.os.windows.CryptReleaseContext</code></li>
          <li><code>std.os.windows.CryptGenRandom</code></li>
        </ul>

      <li>Always link against compiler_rt even when linking libc. Sometimes libgcc is missing things we need,
        so we always link compiler_rt and rely on weak linkage to allow libgcc to override.</li>
      <li>Add compile error notes for where struct definitions are. (<a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1202">#1202</a>)</li>

      <li>Better anonymous struct naming. This makes anonymous structs inherit the name of the
        function they are in only when they are the return expression. Also document the behavior
        and provide examples. (<a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1243">#1243</a>)</li>
      <li>compile error for @noInlineCall on an inline fn (<a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1133">#1133</a>)</li>
      <li>stage1: use os_path_resolve instead of os_path_real to canonicalize imports.
    This means that softlinks can represent different files,
    but referencing the same absolute path different ways
    still references the same import.</li>

      <li>Fix structs that contain types which require comptime. (<a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/586">#586</a>)
        <br> <br>
    Now, if a struct has any fields which require comptime,
    such as <code>type</code>, then the struct is marked as requiring
    comptime as well. Same goes for unions.
    <br> <br>
    This means that a function will implicitly be called
    at comptime if the return type is a struct which contains
    a field of type <code>type</code>.

      <li>better string literal caching implementation
        <br><br>
    We were caching the ConstExprValue of string literals,
    which works if you can never modify ConstExprValues.
    This premise is broken with `comptime var ...`.
        <br><br>
    So I implemented an optimization in ConstExprValue
    arrays, where it stores a <code>Buf *</code> directly rather
    than an array of ConstExprValues for the elements,
    and then similar to array of undefined, it is
    expanded into the canonical form when necessary.
    However many operations can happen directly on the
    <code>Buf *</code>, which is faster.
        <br><br>
    Furthermore, before a ConstExprValue array is expanded
    into canonical form, it removes itself from the string
    literal cache. This fixes the issue, because before an
    array element is modified it would have to be expanded.
